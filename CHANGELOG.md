## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Replace native certificate-verification cryptography with Rust primitives,
  preserving certificate chains, supported algorithms and CRL checks; add
  dependency gates for supported product and binding configurations (#627).

- Deliver streaming text callbacks incrementally, retaining operand state and
  allowing cancellation before parsing the remaining page (#618).

- Recover valid later page content streams after a lexical error without
  losing operands across healthy stream boundaries (#617).

- Preserve separators between independently positioned text objects before
  punctuation, with consistent Tj/TJ coverage (#615).

- Preserve generated footers after imported content without a final newline,
  including trailing comments (#616).

## [5.1.3] - 2026-09-19

### Changed

- **Lenient PDF loading now uses optimized binary pattern search for xref
  recovery.** This substantially reduces startup time for documents that need
  supplementary object-header scanning.
- **Public capability claims are auditable and internally consistent** (#603).
  The PDF/A and signature claims now link to versioned evidence and explicit
  limits; the adoption-monitoring contract defines privacy, deterministic
  decision and append-only audit requirements for `oxidize-stats`.

### Fixed

- **Visible signature text fits both dimensions without losing content** (#606).
  Logos are centered behind the text without reserving a column. Shared
  `SignatureAppearance::layout` preflight wraps text using Helvetica metrics,
  adjusts the font size between 6 and 12 points, and returns an explicit error
  if the complete text cannot fit instead of clipping or omitting lines.
- **Text extraction preserves word boundaries across narrow font changes and
  Form XObject boundaries** (#602). This prevents differential word fusions
  without weakening the committed T3 baseline.

### Added

- **Custom visible incremental-signature appearances** (#596). Callers can
  provide signer text, signing date, additional text, and a bounded RGB image
  watermark through `SignatureAppearance`. The generated font, image, and
  appearance stream are included in the signed incremental revision for both
  new and existing signature widgets.

## [5.1.1] - 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- **Figure text with custom font differences is no longer emitted as reliable
  text when the PDF provides no `/ToUnicode` mapping** (#593, #594).
  Consumers can explicitly retain that fallback text for forensic extraction.

## [5.1.0] - 2026-09-11

### Added

- **Optional URI extraction from interactive link annotations** (#584, #591).
  `TextExtractor::with_link_annotation_extraction(true)` appends safe `/URI`
  action targets in page annotation order without following or executing them.

### Fixed

- **Text extraction resolves indirect font encodings and Adobe Glyph List
  differences** (#572), applies Type 3 `/FontMatrix` scaling to glyph widths
  (#573), and preserves hyphens in numeric and punctuation-bearing identifiers
  across line wraps (#574, #589).
- **Standalone CR, CRLF, and Unicode line separators are normalized
  consistently** (#575), while `TJ` kerning-space detection scales with the
  active font size (#588).
- **Signature preparation tolerates unreferenced in-use xref entries at byte
  offset zero** while still rejecting policy references to such entries (#585).
- **Page annotation arrays accept direct annotation dictionaries** (#590).

## [5.0.1] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- **Layout-preserving plaintext extraction restores document reading quality**
  (#564, #570). `PlainTextExtractor::preserve_layout()` now uses the complete
  text engine and its scale-relative XY-Cut reading order, retaining
  `/ActualText`, artifact filtering, font metrics, and error propagation. On
  the pinned OmniDocBench protocol, global text similarity improves from
  48.26% in v5.0.0 to 60.01%, above the 55% acceptance threshold, while native
  reading-order edit distance remains within its 0.25 limit at 0.22639.

### Changed

- **OmniDocBench quality measurements are reproducible** (#565, #568). The
  versioned gate pins dataset, evaluator, source, extraction configuration, and
  scored-page population provenance, validates materialized Git LFS objects,
  supports split-page PDFs, and seals prediction and summary hashes.

## [5.0.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- **Text extraction now exposes the active PDF rendering mode** (#477, #562).
  Every `TextFragment` reports its `Tr` mode, including invisible OCR text and
  `/ActualText` replacements. Graphics-state restoration preserves the mode,
  malformed operands are handled without integer truncation, and layout
  reconstruction never fuses fragments across rendering-mode boundaries.

### Changed

- **Existing-PDF operations now use one policy-driven API** (#560, #561).
  Merge, split, extraction, reordering, batch processing, signing, and related
  workflows share explicit preservation, validation, and permission policies.
  This major release retires ambiguous legacy entry points; see
  `docs/migration/v5-existing-pdf-operations.md` for migration guidance.
- **`TextFragment` is now non-exhaustive** (#477, #562). External callers must
  construct synthetic fragments with `TextFragment::new` and then set any
  non-default public fields, allowing future extraction metadata to be added
  without another source-breaking struct-field change.

## [4.9.0] - 2026-08-30

### Added

- **Provider-neutral incremental PDF signing** (#540, #558). New two-phase
  preparation and finalization APIs support caller-produced CMS signatures,
  visible and invisible fields, existing-field selection, successive
  signatures, xref tables and streams, and DocMDP and FieldMDP enforcement
  while preserving the source PDF as an exact byte prefix.
- **Lossless incremental FreeText annotation editing** (#534, #553). A typed
  editor can enumerate, add, update, and remove FreeText annotations without
  rebuilding unrelated document content.
- **Lossless incremental Ink annotation editing** (#536, #554). Typed APIs can
  enumerate and atomically mutate ink strokes, appearance properties, and
  annotation metadata while preserving prior PDF bytes.
- **Lossless incremental geometric annotation editing** (#537, #555). Typed
  editors support line, square, circle, polygon, and polyline annotations,
  including geometry, color, opacity, width, dash patterns, and line endings.
- **Atomic page-tree mutation batches** (#538, #556). New planning and mutation
  APIs can reorder, insert, duplicate, and remove pages in one validated,
  lossless incremental revision.
- **Document-semantic preservation for structural operations** (#539, #557).
  Merge, split, extraction, and page mutation APIs preserve or safely reconcile
  outlines, named destinations, page labels, AcroForm state, metadata, and
  associated document structures.

### Changed

- **Obsolete CLI and API release artifacts were retired** (#552). The
  `oxidize-pdf` library is now the sole maintained and published artifact.

## [4.8.0] - 2026-08-27

### Fixed

- **Semantic redaction no longer presents visual masking as irreversible
  removal** (#541). Reports explicitly identify recoverable masking risks, and
  the security-grade API now removes exact direct-page ASCII `Tj` operands and
  complete literal `TJ` arrays backed by verified non-symbolic Standard-14
  fonts. Both `Tj` and `TJ` replacements preserve the original text advance,
  including AFM glyph widths, numeric adjustments, character spacing, and word
  spacing. The API rebuilds the file without prior revisions or document-level
  auxiliary data and verifies output page streams before reporting
  irreversible success.
  It correlates each match with its declared bounding box, audits retained page
  resources and metadata during forensic reparse, and enforces input, page,
  entity, decoded-content, and operation budgets. It fails closed for
  annotations, XObjects, shadings, inline images, marked content, custom or
  ambiguous font encodings, partial or ambiguous matches, and malformed
  streams.

### Added

- **Revision-aware semantic PDF comparison** (#543). A bounded comparison API
  reports visual, textual, structural, metadata, security, and serialization
  differences, attributes changes to incremental revisions, and normalizes
  irrelevant serialization and timestamp noise.
- **Lossless tagged-PDF validation and incremental editing** (#544). Public APIs
  inspect structure trees and PDF/UA findings, then apply bounded edits for
  attributes, MCID associations, ParentTree repair, element creation, and
  reparenting while preserving unrelated bytes and enforcing DocMDP policy.
- **Public outline and bookmark reading** (#548). `PdfDocument` can now parse
  bounded bookmark hierarchies, styles, open state, direct and named
  destinations, GoTo actions, and all standard destination view modes into
  stable zero-based page indexes.
- **Lossless incremental OCR text layers** (#542). Positioned, invisible
  Unicode text can now be appended to existing pages without rebuilding the
  document graph or changing the source-byte prefix. The editor exposes a
  policy-aware dry run, isolated streams and font resources, language,
  confidence, source-region and reading-order metadata, duplicate-layer
  detection, deterministic output, xref-table and xref-stream support, and
  validated atomic publication through `PdfOcrConverter`. Encrypted inputs and
  every DocMDP certification level fail closed because OCR changes page
  content.
- **Lossless incremental page reordering** (#531). The new
  `reorder_pdf_pages_lossless` API preserves the source bytes, indirect page
  identities, inherited page attributes, and unrelated document objects while
  atomically applying an exact page permutation. Encrypted inputs fail closed.
- **DocMDP enforcement for incremental structural edits** (#532). Lossless
  page reordering now permits ordinary approval signatures while parsing and
  enforcing certification transforms, rejecting every certified, malformed,
  ambiguous, or unsupported policy that cannot authorize the structural edit.

## [4.7.0] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- **Incremental editing for highlight annotations** (#525, #527). The new
  `IncrementalHighlightEditor` API can enumerate, add, update, and remove
  `/Highlight` annotations while preserving the original PDF bytes and
  applying validated changes as incremental revisions.

### Fixed

- **Standard-14 fonts without explicit `/Widths` used inaccurate fallback
  advances during text extraction** (#523, #524). Encoding-aware AFM metrics
  now provide per-glyph widths for simple Standard-14 fonts, preventing
  spurious spaces when text is split across consecutive showing operators.
- **CMS signature verification could accept certificates without establishing
  trust in the configured anchors** (#526, #528). Trust validation now fails
  closed while preserving the existing public verification API.
- **Floating-point residue could keep mathematically contiguous text fragments
  separate** (#521, #522). Same-line merging now tolerates rounding noise
  without treating visible overlaps as adjacent or inserting a spurious space.

## [4.6.0] - 2026-08-20

### Added

- **Type 3 font glyph resolution for downstream renderers** (#509). Parser
  consumers can resolve bounded CharProc content streams together with the
  glyph resources and metrics needed to render Type 3 fonts safely.
- **Resolved parser font resources** (#513). The parser now exposes resolved
  Type0, CID, simple, and Symbol font data through public, renderer-oriented
  font resource types while retaining safe fallbacks for malformed PDFs.
- **Bounded in-memory image extraction** (#516). New visitor and collection
  APIs expose encoded image data without temporary files, with configurable
  limits for image count, per-image and total encoded bytes, and decoded
  pixels. Existing file-based extraction APIs remain compatible.

### Fixed

- **Flat-path word-gap threshold compared a `Tm`-scaled pen delta against an
  unscaled font-size threshold** (#510). `flat_space_gap_threshold` derives
  its threshold from the font's real space-glyph advance at the nominal `Tf`
  font size, but the gap it's compared against is measured in user space,
  already scaled by `Tm`/CTM. PDF generators that draw at `Tf 1` with the
  real point size baked into `Tm` instead (a common technique) hit a
  threshold far smaller, relative to the gap, than intended: an ordinary
  sub-point positioning residue between `Tj` runs of the same token (e.g. a
  hyphenated phone number split across separate runs) could cross it and
  insert a spurious mid-token space. The threshold is now scaled by the same
  `Tm`/CTM x-factor already applied to page-space widths elsewhere in
  extraction, together with the horizontal text scaling selected by `Tz`.
- **Indirect `/DecodeParms` references bypassed stream predictors** (#514).
  Filter decoding now resolves indirect parameter dictionaries before
  applying PNG and TIFF predictors, including parameters nested in filter
  arrays, while rejecting cycles and invalid references safely.

## [4.5.1] - 2026-08-19

### Fixed

- **Text extraction ignored structure-element `/ActualText` replacements**
  (#506). The extractor now resolves each marked-content MCID through the
  page's `/StructParents` entry and the document `/ParentTree`, preserving
  inline-over-structure precedence in both flat and layout-preserving modes.
  Resolution is lazy and bounded, malformed structure trees fall back safely
  to visual text, and tagged Form XObjects use their own structural context.

## [4.5.0] - 2026-08-18

### Added

- **Incremental editing for standard text-note annotations** (#493). The new
  typed `IncrementalTextNoteEditor` API can enumerate, add, move, edit, and
  remove `/Text` annotations while preserving the original PDF bytes and
  applying each validated batch as one incremental revision.

### Fixed

- **AES-256 revision 5 encryption dictionaries now emit `/Perms`** (#492),
  restoring interoperability with external readers while retaining strict
  validation of the encrypted permissions block.
- **Flat extraction could fuse adjacent cells in label/value grids** (#495).
  Separate text objects that return backward on the same baseline now receive
  neutral whitespace when the geometry is ambiguous, while genuine long wraps
  still become newlines and legitimate repositioned overlays remain intact.
- **Composite (Type0/CID) font text extraction never consulted the CIDFont's
  `/W`/`/DW` glyph widths** (#496). Every glyph was assumed to advance by a
  flat `0.5 * font_size`, regardless of its real width. When a glyph's true
  advance diverged enough from that flat estimate relative to its neighbors
  (e.g. a genuinely wide glyph in the font), the extractor's pen-tracking
  drifted out of sync with where the next glyph was actually drawn, crossing
  the space-insertion threshold and corrupting the extracted text with a
  spurious space in the middle of a single token. `/W`/`/DW` (ISO 32000-1
  §9.7.4.3) are now parsed into a CID-indexed width table and consulted for
  the composite-font width calculation on both the flat and
  `preserve_layout` extraction paths, falling back to the previous heuristic
  when neither is present.
- **Tagged `ActualText` extraction lost the marked-content association**
  (#498). Generated `ActualText` sequences now carry an MCID connected to the
  structure tree, so tagged extraction returns the replacement text instead
  of dropping it.
- **Real Type0 widths could hide narrow implicit word spaces** (#500). When a
  composite font has no discoverable U+0020 mapping, flat extraction now uses
  a bounded, font-derived CID-width signal that preserves narrow word gaps
  without splitting URLs, identifiers, kerned runs, or positioned overlays.

## [4.4.0] - 2026-08-16

### Added

- **`ActualText` marked-content support** (#63, #490). Page generation can now
  attach replacement text to marked-content sequences, allowing assistive
  technology and text extractors to consume an accessible textual alternative
  for visually rendered content.

### Fixed

- **`preserve_layout`'s global Y-sort could interleave unrelated content
  regions, corrupting hyphen-wrapped words** (#482). `sort_and_merge_fragments`
  sorts every fragment on a page by Y-coordinate with no notion of separate
  content regions; when an unrelated fragment (e.g. a digital-signature
  annotation's appearance text) happened to sit at a Y-coordinate between the
  two halves of a hyphen-wrapped word elsewhere on the page, the sort spliced
  it in between them, and the hyphen got joined to the wrong fragment —
  corrupting both the wrapped word and the unrelated text at once. The initial
  mitigation fused hyphen-wrapped continuations before sorting. Positional
  sorting is now also scoped to structural emission regions: geometric flow
  restarts separate untagged regions, while MCID ownership separates tagged
  regions. Independent body, overlay, annotation, and appearance flows can no
  longer be interleaved merely because their Y ranges overlap.

- **`merge_hyphenated` had no effect on the flat (default) extraction path**
  (#486). It was only wired into `reconstruct_text_from_fragments`
  (`preserve_layout: true`) and `merge_into_paragraphs`
  (`reconstruct_paragraphs: true`); every text-showing operator on the flat
  path (`Tj`, `TJ`, `'`, `"`) independently decided a `'\n'` separator via
  the shared `append_bounded` helper without ever checking for a trailing
  hyphen, so a hyphenated word or number wrapping across two lines extracted
  with a raw newline in place of the hyphen — e.g. a phone number split as
  `"...3016-"` / `"0900"` came out `"...3016-\n0900"` instead of
  `"...30160900"`. `append_bounded` now pops the trailing `-` and fuses the
  next run with no separator when the caller requested `'\n'` and
  `merge_hyphenated` is enabled (the default); the actual separator applied
  is threaded back to callers so reading-order line grouping (#448) treats a
  fused run as a continuation rather than opening a new line.

- **Literal carriage returns in decoded text strings leaked into extracted
  plain text** (#476). `TextExtractor::with_carriage_return_handling` now lets
  callers remove standalone CR bytes, replace them with a space, or preserve
  them while normalizing CRLF without adding a field to the public
  extraction-options struct. The default removes standalone CR so producer
  noise does not split words or URLs; CRLF is treated as one line ending under
  every policy. `NormalizeLineEnding` preserves a standalone CR because it is
  not equivalent to LF (#481).

## [4.3.0] - 2026-08-11

### Fixed

- **Three of the four legal `/DescendantFonts` spellings decoded CID text to
  mojibake** (#469). `extract_font_info` read the entry only when it was a
  direct array whose element is an indirect reference. ISO 32000-1 puts no
  reference requirement on either the array or its element (Table 121, §7.3.6,
  §7.3.7 — where the spec wants a reference it says so, as Table 117 does for
  the CIDFont's FontDescriptor), and producers write the element inline:
  ReportLab's `UnicodeCIDFont` does. For those files `descendant_font` stayed
  empty, `decode_text_with_font` skipped its Type0 branch, and the already
  correct `cid_encoding` (e.g. `UniJIS-UCS2-H` → UTF-16BE) went unused — the
  text fell through to byte-wise decoding. The same defect class as #463, fixed
  here for `/DescendantFonts`: the value may now be a direct array or a
  reference to one, and the CIDFont element a dictionary or a reference.

- **`Tc`, `Tw` and `Ts` were parsed and stored but never applied to extraction**
  (#456). The character-spacing (`Tc`) and word-spacing (`Tw`) parameters are
  now folded into the pen advance and `Ts` (text rise) into the glyph baseline
  (ISO 32000-1 §9.4.4): `Tc` is added once per glyph, `Tw` once per single-byte
  space (code 32, §9.3.3), and `Ts` offsets the fragment's y-origin. Because the
  advance feeds the flat path's space/newline heuristics, documents that set a
  non-zero `Tc`/`Tw` now get correct separators; the `"` operator, which sets
  both before showing a line, now takes effect. `Tr` (render mode, including the
  invisible `Tr 3` OCR-layer case) is unchanged — exposing it on the public
  `TextFragment` is a breaking change deferred to the next major.

- **Two `TJ` operators drawn side by side on one line were glued together**
  (#458). The `Tj` arm turns a forward pen jump wider than the threshold into a
  space, but the `TJ` arm used the same delta only to decide newlines, so
  adjacent multi-column table cells extracted as `CellOneCellTwo` and a list
  bullet welded onto its item text as `vlarge`. A boundary space now fires on
  the first glyph of a `TJ` array when the pen jumped forward past
  `0.7 em` (calibrated on the Tc/Tw-corrected advance from #456; a leading kern
  no longer masks the jump). On the `t3-stress` corpus this cut word fusions
  0.0032 → 0.0014 and reading-order misplacement 0.2766 → 0.2486. An external
  corpus of 421 real-world PDFs (contributor @oshtivi) measured regressed
  detections dropping 177 → 125 with this fix, the largest single-fix drop of
  the cycle.

### Added

- **Opt-in reading-order reorder for the flat text path** (#448), via
  `TextExtractor::with_reading_order(true)`. Off by default (the flat path stays
  byte-identical); when on, the flat `.text` line groups are permuted into
  reading order — left column before right, top block before bottom — using a
  scale-relative XY-cut whose gap thresholds are multiples of the region's
  median glyph size, so column detection is font-size-relative rather than an
  absolute point gap. The text inside each group is untouched. On the
  `t3-stress` corpus this cut reading-order misplacement 0.2486 → 0.2255 at
  identical coverage. It reorders only groups the newline heuristic already
  separated (columns drawn row-interleaved fall in one group), and orders
  `/Rotate ≠ 0` pages in unrotated page space.

## [4.2.3] - 2026-08-09

### Fixed

- **Verbatim page copy dropped an image's nested `/SMask`, losing transparency**
  (#465). `Page::from_parsed_with_content` resolved only the top-level
  `/XObject/<name>` reference; an image's soft-mask stream, referenced from
  inside that image's own dictionary, kept pointing into the *source* document's
  object table. The writer then emitted the image with a dangling `/SMask` and
  never wrote the soft-mask stream, so `merge`, `split`, page extraction and
  rotate all silently stripped transparency. Nested stream references (`/SMask`,
  reference-form `/Mask`, ICCBased colour-space streams) are now inlined on read
  and re-externalized as indirect objects on write, per ISO 32000-1 §7.3.8. The
  resolution walk memoizes by source object id, so a shared stream resolves once
  and a cyclic or pathologically nested document terminates instead of blowing
  up.

- **Page operations reconstructed the page by redrawing it instead of copying it
  verbatim** (#453). Split, reorder, page extraction and rotate each ran the
  content stream through a reconstruction dispatcher that redrew recognised
  operators and silently dropped the rest — images, XObjects, curves — falling
  back to `[content reconstruction in progress]` placeholders and remapping
  fonts to the standard 14. The output was simply wrong. These operations now
  copy the parsed page content verbatim (the same path `merge` uses), and
  `rotate` sets the native `/Rotate` entry `(source + angle).rem_euclid(360)`
  instead of re-rendering.

- **Inline `/Font` resource entries were ignored, producing mojibake on
  round-trip** (#463). A `/Font` resource entry may be a direct dictionary, not
  only an indirect reference (ISO 32000-1 §7.3.7, and what this library's own
  writer emits). All three text extractors cached only the reference form, so an
  inline font dictionary was dropped, the font cache came up empty and text was
  decoded byte-by-byte — every document round-tripped through this library
  (`merge`, the page operations) came back unreadable to the library itself.
  A shared resolver now handles both the reference and the inline-dictionary
  form.

## [4.2.2] - 2026-07-31

### Fixed

- **A literal string reached the object model as a text round-trip of its bytes,
  not as its bytes** (#459). The lexer ran every `(...)` string through an
  encoding-recovery pass that decoded the bytes as text and re-encoded the result
  as UTF-8. For a text string that is harmless; for a binary one it is
  destruction — byte `0xB2` came back as `0xC2 0xB2`. Literal strings now reach
  the object model unchanged, and the strings a PDF defines as *text* are decoded
  where they are read as text, by the new `PdfString::to_text` (ISO 32000-1
  §7.9.2.2: UTF-16BE when a byte order mark is present, PDFDocEncoding
  otherwise).

  Two consequences beyond the reported symptom. Document metadata now decodes
  UTF-16BE `/Title`, `/Author` and the rest, which previously surfaced as
  `þÿ`-prefixed mojibake. And any binary string — `/U`, `/O`, `/Perms`, `/ID`,
  every string in an encrypted document — is now readable, where before only the
  hex-string form of those entries survived. That is why the qpdf-generated
  fixtures in this suite all passed while real Acrobat output failed.

  The consumers that read a string as text decode it explicitly now: AcroForm
  field names (`/T`) and default appearance strings (`/DA`), and the `/T`,
  `/Reason`, `/Location`, `/ContactInfo` and `/M` of a signature. A field named
  with accented characters is addressed by that name, so leaving it undecoded
  would have made the field unfillable.

- **`/U` and `/O` entries longer than 48 bytes were rejected instead of read**
  (#459). ISO 32000-2 §7.6.4.3.3 defines the R5/R6 entries as 48 bytes — a
  32-byte hash and two 8-byte salts — but Acrobat writes them as 127-byte
  strings, zero-padded past byte 48, and those documents open in every
  conforming reader. Both revisions, on the user and the owner path, now read
  the defined 48-byte prefix and ignore what follows. Shorter than 48 is still
  an error: the salts would not fit. The `compute_*` functions build our own
  entries and keep requiring exactly 48 bytes.

  Together with the string fix above, this reopens documents whose *correct*
  password — often the empty one — was reported as `WrongPassword`: the
  reporter's file was a public annual report that opens in any browser.

- **A malformed encryption dictionary was reported as a wrong password** (#459).
  `PdfReader::unlock` collapsed every failure from the encryption handler into
  `WrongPassword`, so a truncated `/U` or an unsupported revision sent the caller
  hunting for a password that does not exist. Errors now surface with their own
  message; a password that merely does not match still yields `WrongPassword`,
  and the owner password still gets its turn before any error is raised.

- **The `q`/`Q` graphics state stack was unbounded in both text extractors**
  (#455). Nothing in a content stream limits how deep `q` nesting goes, so a
  stream of one million `q` operators — about 2 MB — pushed one million
  snapshots. Since #452 each snapshot also carries the text state, including a
  heap allocation for the font name whenever a font is set, so the per-entry
  cost of that flood had roughly doubled. Both extractors now cap the stack at
  1024 entries; Annex C of ISO 32000-1 gives 28 as the historical
  implementation limit for graphics state nesting, so no real document comes
  near it.

  The cap counts the pushes it refuses and answers exactly that many `Q`
  operators with no restore, so every `Q` still pairs with its own `q`. Dropping
  pushes while honouring every `Q` would have been worse than the flood: each
  restore past the cap would hand back the state of a level further out than the
  one it closes, and with the text state now inside each snapshot that changes
  the font in force. Levels within the cap keep restoring exactly; only levels
  deeper than 1024 stop restoring. The count is part of the stack value, so it
  changes hands with it at a Form XObject boundary, where the form already gets
  its own stack.

  This bounds the extractors' own contribution, not the whole path: the content
  parser still materialises a `Vec<ContentOperation>` — 80 bytes per operator —
  for the same stream before either extractor runs.

- **The text state was not restored when a graphics state block closed** (#452).
  Leading, character and word spacing, horizontal scaling, font and size, text
  rise and render mode are text state parameters, and the text state is part of
  the graphics state (ISO 32000-1 §9.3, Table 52) — so `Q` must put them back.
  Only the CTM and the fill colour were restored, so a leading, font or scale
  set inside a `q … Q` block kept driving extraction after the block closed.
  The same omission applied to the implicit save/restore that surrounds a Form
  XObject (§8.10.1): after `Do` the page continued with whatever text state the
  XObject had left behind, which meant text after the `Do` could be decoded
  with the XObject's font instead of the page's. Both sites now share one
  snapshot routine. Additionally, a Form XObject now gets its own graphics
  state stack: a stray `Q` inside it used to pop the *page's* saved state,
  which truncation afterwards could not undo, so the page's own `Q` restored
  from nothing.

  Measured over 8552 corpus PDFs across all six tiers: 26 documents change,
  every one of them for the better. Text that was being decoded with a leaked
  font now decodes correctly (one document goes from 464 to 1420 characters,
  another from `N n Chinese` to `Name in Chinese`, another from `6R` to
  `Sound.`); the rest are a handful of spurious spaces and newlines that the
  separator heuristic no longer synthesises, because the pen advance is now
  computed with the correct font size and scale. No document loses a word and
  none stops extracting. `PlainTextExtractor`, which had no `q`/`Q` handling at
  all, now saves and restores the three text state parameters it tracks.

  The text matrices are deliberately not restored: they are text *object*
  state, established by `BT` and discarded by `ET` (§9.4.1).

- **`PlainTextExtractor` silently dropped all text shown by the `'` and `"`
  operators.** Both are show-text operators (ISO 32000-1 §9.4.3, Table 109):
  `'` is "next line, then show", `"` is "set word and character spacing, next
  line, then show". Neither had a handler in that extractor's operator match,
  so the string operand was never emitted — content loss, not a spacing defect,
  in a re-exported public API, and a disagreement with `TextExtractor` about
  what a document contains. Both now move to the next line and emit their text.
  The spacing operands of `"` are consumed and not stored: this extractor
  derives separators from pen positions rather than from accumulated glyph
  advances.

- **Text extraction ignored the `TD` operator, losing line breaks and fusing
  words** (#451). `tx ty TD` (ISO 32000-1 §9.4.2) is defined as `-ty TL`
  followed by `tx ty Td`: it moves to the next line *and* sets the leading.
  The operator was parsed but had no handler in either extraction path, so it
  fell through to the catch-all: the line break did not exist for the
  extractor (Δx = Δy = 0 at the spacing decision, so the last word of one line
  and the first of the next came out glued) and every later `T*` advanced by a
  stale leading. Measured over the 1802-PDF stress corpus against poppler
  `pdftotext`, implementing it takes word fusions from 6298 to 752 (−88%), and
  the opposite metric improves too (words lost 7428 → 5545). No threshold
  change moved either metric, which is the signature of a missing operator
  rather than a mis-tuned heuristic. Fixed in the two text-extraction paths,
  `TextExtractor` and `PlainTextExtractor`, which carry independent operator
  matches. Other content-stream consumers in the crate keep their own operator
  matches and still ignore `TD`; they are tracked separately.

## [4.2.1] - 2026-07-22

### Fixed

- **Flat-path separator heuristics measured pen movement in post-CTM user
  space, corrupting line structure under a rotated CTM** (#443).
  A plain forward advance along a rotated baseline changes the user-space y,
  which the newline gate misread as a line change (spurious newlines
  everywhere), and the rotation gave every same-baseline glyph a nonzero Δy,
  defeating the #441 same-line gate. Pen deltas are now projected onto the
  current text baseline direction (the image of the text-space x-axis under
  `Tm × CTM`): Δx along the baseline, Δy perpendicular to it. For
  axis-aligned content the projection is exactly the previous Δx/Δy — no
  behavior change — and under rotation it recovers the text's own line
  geometry, so all the `Tj`/`TJ` separator gates (newline threshold, space
  threshold, backward-jump wrap) now hold for rotated text. Mirrored
  (negative-x-scale) baselines now measure Δx along the text's own advance
  direction, so plain forward advances no longer misfire the backward-jump
  wrap gate. Axis-aligned shear projects exactly; shear combined with a
  rotated baseline is approximated. The tracked pen position is the full
  post-advance point, so rotated baselines advance y as well as x.
  Degenerate (zero-length or non-finite) baselines fall back to raw
  user-space deltas. The two line-structure invariants pinned to #443
  (rotation property + 20° deterministic pin) flip from `#[ignore]` to
  permanent guards.
- **A same-line backward X jump was misread as a line wrap** (#441). The
  flat-path heuristic added for #390 treated any backward pen jump beyond
  2× `newline_threshold` as a wrap, ignoring Δy — so glyphs repositioned
  backward on the same baseline (justification, out-of-order emission) gained
  a spurious newline mid-word. In axis-aligned text a wrap always lands on a
  different baseline: the heuristic now also requires a nonzero Δy, in both
  the `Tj` and `TJ` handlers. Tight-leading wraps (small but nonzero Δy, the
  #390 class) still break. (Rotated/sheared CTMs were initially outside this
  gate's reach; closed by the #443 fix above in this same release.) A new
  line-structure property invariant guards both directions —
  spurious and missing newlines — against generated layouts whose true line
  structure is known by construction.

## [4.2.0] - 2026-07-21

### Fixed

- **A lone space decoded from `/ToUnicode` was discarded as garbage** (#438).
  Both `/ToUnicode` paths tested a decode for usability by trimming it first, so
  a code mapping to exactly `U+0020` trimmed to empty and was rejected — the
  extractor then fell back to the raw code and emitted the byte as a literal
  ASCII character, corrupting word boundaries in subsetted-font documents. The
  simple-font and CID paths had diverging copies of that predicate; they now
  share one, and a decode is unusable only when it produced no characters at all
  or nothing but non-whitespace control codes. Whitespace is real text. The
  shared predicate also tightened the CID path, which previously accepted C1
  control codes (U+0080–U+009F) as genuine text.
- **Chunk budgets were decided on a sum of per-element token counts** (#435).
  The decision summed what each element cost separately while the emitted chunk
  measured the elements joined — equal only for a counter that is additive
  across the separator, which BPE is not. So a chunk could be approved on a cost
  that was never measured, and exceed `max_tokens` in the tokenizer that
  governed the split. Every budget decision now measures the text it is about to
  emit: the merge check, the sentence splitter, and the oversize flag on split
  fragments. A fragment that still exceeds the budget is flagged rather than
  passed off as within it.
- **Paragraphs ran together across a font change in extraction** (#436). A
  change of font size or weight now ends the paragraph, so a heading set in the
  same block as its body no longer merges into one run of text.

### Added

- **`TokenCounter::is_additive_over_whitespace_join`**, a defaulted trait method
  (`false`, the safe answer) by which a counter declares that
  `count(a) + count(b)` equals the cost of joining `a` and `b` with any single
  whitespace character. The chunker uses it to accumulate a budget in O(1)
  instead of re-tokenizing the whole buffer per candidate; `WordProxyCounter`,
  the default, declares `true`, and the BPE counter correctly does not. Existing
  implementors are unaffected — the default keeps the measured, always-correct
  path.
- **Property-based invariant suites for the RAG pipeline and font mapping**,
  continuing the bug-class guards begun in 4.1.1. Chunking: the chunk set is a
  faithful partition of the input (every element in exactly one chunk, every
  word conserved, input order preserved, pages the union of their elements'),
  the stamped token count measures the content the budget governs, no chunk
  exceeds its budget under either counter, and an oversized fragment is
  irreducible rather than over-packed. End-to-end: text conservation from
  written PDF to chunk, and a breadcrumb that never names a later heading.
  Fonts: the mapping invariant across every mechanism a document has for saying
  what a code means (WinAnsi, subset `/ToUnicode`, Identity-H, CID table) plus a
  coverage report that agrees with what survives extraction. Token counters: a
  counter's additivity claim is verified against it, over every separator the
  claim covers. #435, #436 and #438 were all reproduced from the contract by
  these suites.

### Changed

- **`is_oversized` is now set on sentence-split fragments that exceed the
  budget.** Previously such a fragment always reported `false`, regardless of
  its real cost. Consumers filtering on this field will see more `true`s; that
  is the honest answer, and the reason #435 was invisible.

## [4.1.1] - 2026-07-16

### Security

- **Owner-password unlock fail-open and its fail-safe twin (#430).** The RC4/MD5
  owner-unlock path (R2-R4) decrypted `/O` to the 32-byte padded user password,
  then reconstructed a string by truncating at the first standard-padding byte
  (`0x28`, `(`). Two faults, one root cause: (a) a **fail-open** — with a wrong
  owner password the 32 bytes are garbage, and whenever the first byte was
  `0x28` the derived password collapsed to `""`, which re-padded to the standard
  padding and authenticated any document with an empty user password, granting
  owner access on ~1/256 of wrong attempts; (b) **#430**, a fail-safe twin —
  a legitimate user password of `(` also truncated to `""`, so the correct owner
  password no longer unlocked. The path now runs the decrypted bytes through the
  standard `/U` verifier (ISO 32000-1 §7.6.3.4, Algorithm 3) with no truncation,
  closing both. Also hardened owner unlock against a short `/O` (was a reachable
  panic). Found by the encryption round-trip invariant, not a field report.

### Fixed

- **Two parser panics on malformed page dictionaries.** The manual recovery
  path, which rebuilds page objects from raw text when the xref is unusable,
  sliced strings with unvalidated indices in three places. A page dictionary
  whose `/MediaBox` closer preceded its opener (`/MediaBox ][`) produced an
  inverted range ("byte range starts at 26 but ends at 22"); a `/Resources`
  dictionary containing any non-UTF-8 byte scanned a `Vec<char>` with
  byte-derived indices and split the resulting U+FFFD ("not a char boundary");
  a third site truncated a debug string mid-char. All three now go through
  total helpers that cannot panic on any input, and the two duplicated
  nested-dictionary scanners are unified into one. Reachable in **every**
  strictness mode, including `strict`. Found pre-report by the new
  parser-never-panics invariant, not by a user; both inputs are pinned as fuzz
  regression fixtures.
- **Parser panic on malformed input** (#427). `find_catalog_by_content`'s
  extreme-last-resort catalog scan sliced a `from_utf8_lossy` string at a byte
  index that could fall inside a multibyte replacement char (U+FFFD), panicking
  with "not a char boundary". Now advances past the whole char. A recurrence of
  #93 in a sibling recovery path, surfaced by the new fuzzing harness; the fix
  itself landed via #428, and the harness's regression fixture guards it here.
- **Incremental updates resolved to a stale page tree** (#426). When the primary
  xref was malformed and lenient recovery scanned the file, the recovered
  object map kept the *first* (oldest) definition of each object number, so a
  `/Pages` root redefined by an incremental update resolved to the stale
  revision — silently dropping pages. Recovery now keeps the *last* definition,
  per ISO 32000-1 §7.5.6 (last-write-wins).
- **`reorder_columns` scattered tokens across the page** (#425). The block-merge
  gate only checked each line's column gaps against the immediately preceding
  line, so unrelated wide gaps chained through accumulated drift into one giant
  false "columnar block" that bucketed and relocated any token in its span. The
  gate now anchors alignment to the whole block, and a column boundary must
  recur across ≥2 rows. Fifth and final failure mode of the column-reorder
  family (#389, #403, #408, #417, #422).

### Added

- **Coverage-guided fuzzing harness** (`fuzz/`, cargo-fuzz) for the parser and
  text-extraction pipeline, with a stable regression bridge that replays
  minimized crashes in the normal test run.
- **Property-based invariant suites** guarding whole bug classes rather than
  single reported instances: text extraction (character conservation,
  reorder-is-a-permutation, token contiguity, determinism), the parser
  (incremental-update last-write-wins; never-panic over arbitrary, mutated, and
  truncated bytes across all strictness modes), fonts (measured glyph width
  matches the real metric; WinAnsi round-trip), and encryption (user/owner
  password round-trip and wrong-password-never-unlocks, across RC4-40/128 and
  AES-128/256). Several of these caught unreported defects before release.

## [4.1.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added

- **Type 4 (free-form Gouraud triangle mesh) shading** (#407). New public
  `FreeFormGouraudShading` + `GouraudVertex` (re-exported from `graphics`)
  emit a Type 4 mesh as a PDF stream per ISO 32000-1 §8.7.4.5.5 — the shading
  dictionary plus byte-aligned packed vertex data (configurable
  `BitsPerCoordinate`/`BitsPerComponent`/`BitsPerFlag` and `Decode`). Register
  on a page with `Page::add_mesh_shading`.
- **Exact conic (angular) gradient** (#407). New public `ConicShading` emits a
  Type 1 function-based shading whose `/Function` is a real Type 4 PostScript
  calculator (angle around a center → colour ramp), so conic gradients are
  resolution-independent rather than a mesh approximation. Register with
  `Page::add_conic_shading`. This unblocks lossless `conic-gradient` rendering
  downstream. The pre-existing hollow `FunctionBasedShading` placeholder is
  unchanged.

  Both are additive: `ShadingDefinition` and existing types are untouched, so
  this is a minor release. Folding the new shadings into `ShadingDefinition`
  and removing the `FunctionBasedShading` placeholder are deferred to the next
  major.

### Fixed

- `reorder_columns` no longer merges unrelated normal-leading lines that each
  contain a wide gap at a different X into a false column block, which shredded
  tokens (e.g. CNPJ identifiers in label/value forms). Column blocks now require
  the wide gaps to align horizontally across rows (#422).
- **`reorder_columns` no longer shreds dense prose** (#417, follow-up to #408).
  `detect_and_sort_columns` grouped lines with a fixed `newline_threshold` band
  keyed to the previous fragment, merging tight-leading prose into one
  pseudo-line, and then treated consecutive lines that each held an incidental
  wide gap as a multi-column table, reordering them column-major and splitting
  tokens. Line grouping is now head-anchored (matching #408), and a multi-line
  column block only forms when its rows are at least one line height apart;
  tighter blocks are left in reading order. Real tables / multi-column layouts
  are unaffected. Only the opt-in `reorder_columns` / `detect_columns` path was
  affected.

## [4.0.1] - 2026-07-12

### Fixed

- **Indirect `/Kids` and `/Count` page trees now parse** (#415). A `/Pages` node
  that stores `/Kids` or `/Count` as an indirect reference (`N G R`) instead of
  inline — spec-legal per ISO 32000-1 §7.3.10, emitted by iText — made
  `page_count()` return 0 and `extract_text()` return empty text with no error.
  One level of indirection is now resolved consistently across the page-tree
  flat index, `PdfReader::page_count()`, and PDF/A page-walk validation.
- **LZW `EarlyChange` code-width boundary** (#415). The decoder widened the code
  one entry too late (`2^width` instead of `2^width - 1` under the default
  `EarlyChange=1`), desyncing streams that grew past 511/1023/2047 dictionary
  entries and failing with `invalid code`. Corrected per ISO 32000-1 §7.4.4.2.

### Security

- Bumped `quick-xml` 0.39 → 0.41 to clear **RUSTSEC-2026-0194** and
  **RUSTSEC-2026-0195** — DoS advisories (quadratic duplicate-attribute check;
  unbounded namespace-declaration allocation) reachable through untrusted XMP
  metadata. Also dropped its unused `serialize` (serde) feature; XMP parsing
  uses only the streaming pull-parser (#416).

## [4.0.0] - 2026-07-10

### BREAKING CHANGES

- `TableElementData` (`oxidize_pdf::pipeline`), and `DetectedTable` / `TableCell`
  (`oxidize_pdf::text::table_detection`) are now `#[non_exhaustive]` and gained new public
  fields (rich table structure / cell spans / header rows). External code can no longer
  construct these with a struct literal or match them exhaustively. Migration: build
  `TableElementData` via `TableElementData::new(rows, metadata)` (flat) or
  `TableElementData::from_structure(structure, metadata)` (rich); build `TableCell` via
  `TableCell::new(..)` and `DetectedTable` via `DetectedTable::new(..)`. (#375)
- **Contextual chunking API (#376).** `HybridChunkConfig` gained a `context_mode` field
  (`ContextMode`), so full struct-literal construction now requires it — use
  `HybridChunkConfig { max_tokens, ..Default::default() }`. The default (`ContextMode::Heading`)
  is byte-identical to previous output. New enum `ContextFormat` is `#[non_exhaustive]`.
- **Bounded extraction fields (#382).** `ExtractionOptions` gained `max_extracted_bytes:
  Option<usize>` and `ExtractedText` gained `truncated: bool`, so full struct-literal
  construction of `ExtractionOptions` now requires the new field — use
  `ExtractionOptions { ..Default::default() }`.
- **Output-type hardening.** `ExtractedText` (`oxidize_pdf::text`) and `ContentTypeFlags`
  (`oxidize_pdf::pipeline`) are now `#[non_exhaustive]`, so future fields can be added without a
  breaking change. External code can no longer construct them with a struct literal: build
  `ExtractedText` via `ExtractedText::new(text, fragments)`, and `ContentTypeFlags` via
  `ContentTypeFlags::default()` + field assignment.

### Added

- **RAG table extraction quality (#375).** Merged cells (rowspan/colspan) and header rows are
  now represented by a rich `TableStructure` / `RichCell` model on `TableElementData.structure`,
  populated from hard signals — drawn-grid dividers (merged cells) and PDF structure tags
  (header rows). The flat `rows` view is derived from it (spanned values repeated). GFM export
  collapses multi-level headers (joined with `›`) and repeats merged-cell values; RAG chunk
  metadata (`table_rows`/`table_cols`) counts the rich geometry. Borderless tables and
  un-tagged multi-level headers remain flat — see `docs/TABLE_DETECTION_GUIDE.md`.
- **Contextual Retrieval (no-ML) for RAG chunks (#376).** Opt-in `ContextMode::Contextual`
  prepends a deterministic document + section snippet (title/author or filename, heading
  breadcrumb, optional page span) to each chunk's `full_text` (the embedding text) while the
  display `text` stays context-free. Two formats — `ContextFormat::Labeled` and `Prose`. The
  prefix is a pure function of the source, breadcrumb and page span, so `chunk_id` stays
  deterministic. Threaded through every `rag_chunks_with*` entry and the `unstable-spi`
  pipeline (`AnalysisPipeline::with_context_mode`).
- **Per-page extraction memory bound (#382).** `ExtractionOptions::max_extracted_bytes` caps
  decoded-text accumulation *during* a page run (across the show-text arms, TJ spacing, Form
  XObject recursion, and `/ActualText` overrides), so an adversarially inflated content stream
  cannot materialise an unbounded `String`. Undershoot semantics: extraction stops before the
  run that would overshoot (never splits a UTF-8 char); `ExtractedText::truncated` reports it.
  `None` (default) is byte-identical to before.

### Fixed

- **Table detection no longer silently drops page text (#375).** A detected table now claims
  only fragments it actually placed in a cell (both ruling and spatial detectors); text inside
  the table bounding box but not in any cell falls back to prose instead of being discarded.
  Near-empty tables (< 2 populated cells) decompose to prose. Guarded by a text-conservation
  invariant test.
- **Dense prose no longer shredded under column reorder (#408).** `reorder_columns` /
  `preserve_layout` fragmented dense paragraphs character-by-character because
  `sort_and_merge_fragments` ran twice; the double pass is removed. A `NaN` Y anchor now
  breaks the line instead of swallowing the rest of the page.

## [3.1.1] - 2026-07-07

### Fixed

- **AES-256 owner-password (R5/R6) hashing** is now spec-compliant and
  interoperable with conforming readers: the R6 sites no longer double-include
  the `password‖salt‖U` blob, and the R5 sites include the 48-byte `/U` entry
  as Adobe extension level 3 requires. Owner-password unlock and writer
  round-trips now match qpdf/Adobe. (#380)
- **Missing or corrupt cross-reference tables** are now reconstructed by default
  via the object-header scan (poppler/pdf.js/qpdf-style robustness), so PDFs
  that previously failed with `Invalid xref table` open. The recovery path
  preserves `/Encrypt` and `/ID`, so an encrypted document whose xref must be
  rebuilt can never open as plaintext; `ParseOptions::strict()` still fails
  loudly. (#374)
- **Preserved embedded fonts** whose `/Font` resource key collides with a
  writer-injected base-14 font (e.g. `/Helvetica`) are no longer silently
  dropped. Disambiguation is now collision-only, and the preserved content
  stream is rewritten with a structure-preserving tokenizer that handles
  operators split across lines and never touches a name inside a string or
  comment literal. (#395)
- **Negative stream `/Length`** no longer aborts the process with a
  capacity-overflow panic (a denial-of-service surface). Invalid negative
  lengths fall back to a bounded `endstream` search in lenient mode and a clean
  error in strict mode. (#401)

## [3.1.0] - 2026-07-06

### Added

- `TokenCounter` trait (`pipeline::token_counter`) with a zero-dependency
  `WordProxyCounter` default and a feature-gated `TiktokenCounter` (cl100k_base,
  behind the new `tiktoken` feature). `HybridChunker`/`SemanticChunker` gain
  `with_token_counter(..)`; each chunk stamps its `token_estimate` with the
  active counter, and `PdfDocument::rag_chunks_with_counter(config, counter)`
  injects a counter into the RAG path. The default build is byte-identical
  (word-proxy) and pulls no new dependency (#377).
- `ExtractionOptions.reorder_columns` (opt-in, default `false`): on the flat
  text path (`preserve_layout = false`), reorders output by column so
  per-column tokens stay adjacent in multi-column tables (emails/phones split
  across draw operators become detectable again). Reuses the existing
  column-detection machinery; `.fragments` stays empty; default off is
  byte-identical (#389).

### Fixed

- Flat-text extraction no longer glues the last word of one visual line to the
  first word of the next when the line height is below `newline_threshold` and
  the line wraps back to the left: a large backward horizontal jump is now
  treated as a line break in both the `Tj` and `TJ` handlers (#390).

## [3.0.4] - 2026-06-29

### Changed

- `PdfDocument<R>` is now `Send` for `R: Send`. The internal
  `Rc<ResourceManager>` (which was never cloned or shared) is replaced by an
  owned `ResourceManager` field; the inner `RefCell` cache is unchanged, so
  there is no locking overhead and no behavioral change. This lets callers move
  a document across threads — concretely, the Python bindings can release the
  GIL (`Python::allow_threads`) around reader operations. `PdfDocument` remains
  `!Sync` (#369).

## [3.0.3] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- `PdfDocument::rag_chunks_from_elements(elements, pipeline)` (feature
  `unstable-spi`): run a custom `AnalysisPipeline` (classifier → chunking →
  enrichers) over caller-provided `Element`s instead of the document's own
  partition. Lets a consumer feed externally-recovered content (e.g. list items
  a two-column layout scrambles past the partitioner) into the same enriched
  chunk flow, mixing partitioned and recovered elements. `rag_chunks_with_pipeline`
  is now `rag_chunks_from_elements(partition_with(cfg)?, pipeline)` and keeps its
  exact behaviour. Additive and behind `unstable-spi` only — no stable API change
  (#360).

## [3.0.2] - 2026-06-28

### Fixed

- AES-128 and AES-256 documents written by the crate can now be read back.
  Previously their encrypted content decrypted to empty (text extraction
  returned nothing) even with the correct password; RC4-128 was unaffected.
  Three root causes (#364, reported by @peter-ssk):
  - **AES-128 (R4)**: the reader chose the cipher by encryption revision and
    decrypted AESV2 streams with RC4. The cipher is now selected from the
    `/CFM` crypt filter (`/StmF` → `/CF` → `/CFM`), so real-world R4+RC4 files
    keep working too.
  - **AES-256 (R5)**: the writer encrypted objects with a password-derived key
    instead of the random file key sealed in `/UE`, which the reader recovers;
    the keys differed. The writer now uses the key sealed in `/UE`.
  - Decryption failures were swallowed into empty content (silent data loss);
    the reader now surfaces them as errors.
- Owner-password unlock of AES-256 documents now works, and unlocking an
  AES-256 document with a wrong password no longer panics (the R5/R6 owner
  path was previously unimplemented and fell through to R2–R4 logic).

### Security

- Removed debug `eprintln!` statements that leaked the derived encryption key
  and user password to stderr in debug builds.

## [3.0.1] - 2026-06-26

### Fixed

- Pages whose `/Resources` reference the `/Font` dictionary indirectly
  (`/Font 1 0 R`) rather than inline now keep their fonts when rebuilt via
  `Page::from_parsed_with_content` (e.g. when merging PDFs). Previously the
  font-resolution step matched only an inline dictionary, so the indirect
  reference was carried over unresolved and the embedded fonts were lost,
  rendering text with the wrong font or invisibly. Reported and fixed by
  @Hatell (#362).

## [3.0.0] - 2026-06-25

This is a major release. It introduces a CID-keyed positioned-glyph-run write API
(issue #358) and contains two breaking changes to the public API surface. Code that
only uses the high-level document/page/text APIs is unaffected; the breaking changes
touch the low-level font modules.

### Added

- CID-keyed positioned glyph runs (issue #358). A new write path embeds Identity-H
  Type0/CIDFontType2 fonts where the CID equals the glyph id, emits the text as a
  `TJ` array, and produces a valid `ToUnicode` CMap so the result stays extractable.
  - `Document::add_cid_keyed_font` registers a CID-keyed font on a path kept separate
    from the Unicode-keyed embedding path (the two are never mixed by construction).
  - `GraphicsContext::show_cid_array(&[CidShowElement])` writes a positioned run.
    `CidShowElement` carries `cid`, `adjust` (advance kern) and `x_offset` (per-glyph
    horizontal shift, emitted as paired `TJ` adjustments without consuming advance).
    Constructed via `CidShowElement::new(cid, adjust)` and `with_x_offset(..)`; the
    type is `#[non_exhaustive]`.
  - The embedded font is **subset by used GIDs**, reusing the active char-driven
    subsetter pipeline. `CIDToGIDMap` is remapped from `/Identity` to a compact
    stream. Measured on a 2-glyph document: 268,432 → 6,465 bytes (-97.6%). Falls
    back to full embedding if subsetting fails.
  - `CidMapping` gained `cid_to_unicode_str: HashMap<u16, String>` so a single CID
    (e.g. an `fi` ligature glyph) maps back to several characters in the `ToUnicode`
    CMap.
- `Op::ShowTextArray` content operator for `TJ`.

### BREAKING CHANGES

- Removed the non-functional glyph-driven subsetter
  `oxidize_pdf::text::fonts::truetype_subsetting` and its public re-exports
  `TrueTypeSubsetter`, `SubsettingOptions`, and `SubsetStatistics`. These types had
  stubbed `loca`/`cmap` handling and no production call-sites. Font subsetting is
  handled by the char-driven subsetter (`truetype_subsetter`), which is unchanged.
  Migration: callers (none expected) should drop these imports; subsetting happens
  automatically during font embedding.
- `oxidize_pdf::fonts::CidMapping` is now `#[non_exhaustive]` and gained a new public
  field (`cid_to_unicode_str`). External code can no longer construct it with a struct
  literal or match it exhaustively. Migration: build it via `CidMapping::new()` (or
  `Default::default()`) and populate the public fields.

## [2.16.6] - 2026-06-23

### Fixed

- The manual stream-reconstruction recovery path (used when a PDF's cross-reference
  table is damaged or absent) rebuilt each stream dictionary recognizing only the
  single hardcoded `/Filter /FlateDecode` form. Every other entry was dropped —
  non-Flate filters (`/DCTDecode`, `/LZWDecode`), filter arrays, `/DecodeParms`,
  `/Subtype`, `/ColorSpace`, etc. When this path fired on a non-Flate stream, the
  missing `/Filter` made downstream decoding treat compressed bytes as raw, a silent
  wrong result. The dictionary is now re-parsed in full with the real object parser,
  preserving every entry generically. The bounded-memory guarantees from #339 are
  unchanged: stream bodies are still read bounded by `/Length` (or a bounded scan to
  `endstream`), never the whole file. (#351)

### Changed

- Deduplicated two byte-identical binary-substring search helpers
  (`reader::find_bytes` and `xref::find_byte_pattern`) into a single `pub(crate)`
  implementation, removing the risk of silent divergence. No behavior change. (#352)

## [2.16.5] - 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- Lenient parsing of a PDF with a damaged or absent cross-reference table could
  read the entire file into memory. The v2.16.2 fix bounded the xref-scan sites,
  but three per-object manual-extraction fallbacks in the reader still buffered the
  whole file via `read_to_end` — reachable through `info()` / `catalog()` and page
  recovery on a partially damaged xref. All three now locate the object via a
  chunked, early-stopping scan and read only a bounded window, so peak memory is
  O(window) regardless of file size. Stream bodies are read bounded by `/Length`
  (direct, indirect resolved without recursion, or absent via a bounded scan to
  `endstream`), so large XMP metadata is no longer truncated. Signature
  verification still reads the full file, as its digest covers the entire
  `/ByteRange`. Completes the bounded-memory work for #339.
- Manual stream reconstruction now trusts a direct `/Length` exactly instead of
  truncating at the first `endstream` byte sequence, which previously corrupted
  binary streams whose data legitimately contains the bytes `endstream`.
- Page recovery now also detects the compact `/Type/Page` spelling (no space before
  the value), valid per ISO 32000-1 §7.3.5 and emitted by some generators.

## [2.16.4] - 2026-06-21

### Added

- `AnalysisPipeline::with_partition_config` (unstable `unstable-spi`): a custom
  analysis pipeline can now run over a configurable partition. Previously
  `rag_chunks_with_pipeline` always partitioned with the default `PartitionConfig`,
  so a structure-aware consumer could not avoid the table detector turning
  single-column prose pages into empty `table` elements. The default round-trips to
  the previous behaviour. Addresses the API part of #345 (the table-detector quality
  issue remains open as a follow-up).

### Fixed

- PDF/A validation reported an otherwise-conformant document as non-conformant when
  its XMP `/Metadata` stream was `/Filter /FlateDecode`-compressed: the validator
  read the raw, still-compressed bytes instead of decoding them, so the XMP packet
  was never parsed (`XmpMetadataMissing` / `XmpMissingPdfAIdentifier`). The stream is
  now decoded before parsing; an unfiltered stream is unaffected. Fixes #346.

## [2.16.3] - 2026-06-19

### Fixed

- Cross-reference streams (`/Type /XRef`, standard since PDF 1.5 and ubiquitous in
  linearized / government documents) were decoded twice: the reader decoded the
  stream and then `XRefStream::parse` re-applied the still-present `/Filter` to the
  already-inflated bytes, yielding 0 bytes and a bogus "Xref stream data truncated"
  error. This broke the strict reader path (`PdfReader::new`) for every xref-stream
  PDF — including documents oxidize-pdf writes itself — and surfaced as "Pages is
  not a dictionary" on the lenient path when object-scan recovery could not
  compensate. `parse` now treats its input as already decoded and no longer
  re-applies the filter; on decode failure the reader goes straight to recovery
  instead of feeding raw compressed bytes to the parser. Fixes #341.

## [2.16.2] - 2026-06-17

### Fixed

- Lenient parsing loaded the entire file into memory via `read_to_end`, defeating
  the seek-based reader and risking excessive memory use / OOM on large or
  malformed PDFs. The hybrid missing-object scan — which runs on every lenient
  parse, including `PdfReader::open` (lenient by default) — and the XRef recovery
  path now locate object headers with a chunked, seek-based scan, keeping peak
  memory at O(chunk) instead of O(file). Parsing behaviour and the public API are
  unchanged. Fixes #339.

### Changed

- XRef recovery now selects the catalog object deterministically (sorted object
  iteration instead of `HashMap` order), making recovered-document output stable
  across runs.

## [2.16.1] - 2026-06-16

### Fixed

- `ExtractionProfile::Presentation` collapsed slide-shape grids (parallel
  columns of bullets) to a `Table` element. The profile now opts out of the
  spatial-cluster table detector via a new `PartitionConfig.detect_spatial_tables`
  knob (default `true`, set to `false` only by `Presentation`). Ruling-based
  detection remains active. Fixes #329.
- `TextExtractor::extract_from_page` returned non-empty `.text` with zero
  `.fragments` on pages wrapped entirely in `/Artifact BMC … EMC` (a common
  pattern for slide-deck closing legal-disclaimer pages). Such pages were
  invisible to `partition_with(...)` / `rag_chunks(...)` even though the user
  saw text in `.text`. `extracted_text` now uses the same artifact gate as
  fragment emission (`skip_artifact_text`). Fixes #330.
- XMP serializer emitted `xmlns:*` namespace declarations in HashMap
  iteration order, breaking PDF byte-reproducibility. Custom namespace
  storage migrated to `BTreeMap` and the local namespace map inside
  `to_xmp_packet` is now sorted. Fixes #331.
- `XmpValue::Struct` and `XmpValue::ArrayStruct` field elements were emitted
  in HashMap iteration order under `<rdf:Description>` and
  `<rdf:li rdf:parseType="Resource">`. Internal storage migrated to
  `BTreeMap` (public API kept `HashMap` parameters; values are sorted
  on insert). Fixes #334 items #1–#3.
- `FontCache::font_names()` returned font names in `HashMap` iteration order,
  yielding non-deterministic PDF font ObjectId assignments across builds.
  Now sorts before returning. Fixes #334 item #5.

## [2.16.0] - 2026-06-14

### Added

- Rich chunk metadata for RAG: every `RagChunk` now carries a nested
  `ChunkMetadata` (`oxidize_pdf::pipeline`) with the section breadcrumb
  (`heading_path`), char-weighted dominant font/size and bold/italic flags,
  the lowest element confidence (`min_confidence`), content-type flags
  (`has_table`/`has_list`/`has_code`/`heading_only`), char/word/sentence
  counts, a deterministic `chunk_id`, and prev/next chunk links. `RagChunk`
  and the new metadata types are `#[non_exhaustive]`.
- `PdfDocument::rag_chunks_with_source(DocumentSource)` and
  `rag_chunks_with_source_and_config(DocumentSource, HybridChunkConfig)`: build
  chunks stamped with source-document metadata, the latter also honouring a
  custom token budget. Auto-fill `title`/`author`/`creation_date`/`total_pages`
  from the info dictionary (caller values win); the caller's `doc_hash` becomes
  the stable `chunk_id` prefix. `DocumentSource::with_file(filename, doc_hash)`
  is the ergonomic constructor for the two caller-supplied fields.
- Optional per-chunk language detection behind the existing
  `language-detection` feature: `pipeline::detect_language(text)` returns the
  dominant ISO 639-3 code (via `whatlang`), and `ChunkMetadata::language` is
  populated when the feature is enabled. `ChunkMetadata::language_confidence`
  and `language_reliable` surface `whatlang`'s confidence and reliability so
  consumers can gate language-based routing.
- Citation anchor on `ChunkMetadata`: `page_span: Option<(u32, u32)>` and
  `page_regions: Vec<PageRegion>` (the union bounding box of the chunk's
  elements per page), giving RAG consumers an exact region of the source PDF to
  cite back to. New `pipeline::PageRegion { page, bbox }`.
- Table dimensions on `ChunkMetadata`: `table_rows`/`table_cols` (largest table
  in the chunk) for table-aware retrieval.
- **Analysis SPI** (unstable, behind the new `unstable-spi` feature): extension
  points that let a closed crate plug custom analysis into the RAG pipeline
  without forking the MIT core. The trait surface is exempt from semver while
  experimental.
  - `ChunkingStrategy` (`pipeline::ChunkingStrategy`) + `ChunkGroup`: decide how
    elements group into chunks; the pipeline still owns `chunk_id`, prev/next
    links, `oversized`, and `ChunkMetadata`. `HybridChunker` is the default impl
    (`impl ChunkingStrategy for HybridChunker`), so a custom strategy can wrap it
    and refine.
  - `ElementClassifier` (`pipeline::ElementClassifier`) + `ClassLabel` +
    `ClassifyContext`: assign an open string label to each element before
    chunking, stored on the new `ElementMetadata::class_label`. A chunking
    strategy may read it to drive boundaries.
  - `MetadataEnricher` (`pipeline::MetadataEnricher`) + `EnrichContext` (both
    additionally behind `semantic`): write provider-specific fields into a
    chunk's open `extra` bag after metadata is derived; enrichers run in
    registration order.
  - `ChunkMetadata::extra: BTreeMap<String, serde_json::Value>` (behind
    `semantic`): open, namespaced metadata bag, serialized nested under `extra`
    and omitted when empty (no output change unless populated).
  - `AnalysisPipeline` builder + `PdfDocument::rag_chunks_with_pipeline`:
    run a strategy/classifier/enrichers over a document. `AnalysisPipeline::new()`
    reproduces `rag_chunks()` exactly (verified by a parity test). Every existing
    `rag_chunks*` entry point is unchanged.

## [2.15.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- `IncrementalFormFiller` (`oxidize_pdf::writer`): fill AcroForm fields on an
  existing, already-serialized PDF and recover the value via a form reader.
  It appends a conformant ISO 32000-1 §7.5.6 incremental update — the original
  bytes are preserved verbatim, only the modified field objects and the
  `/AcroForm` dict are rewritten (with a partial cross-reference section, a
  chained `/Prev`, and a regenerated `/ID`). Resolves hierarchical field names
  (`/Kids` + `/Parent`) and terminal fields whose `/Kids` are widget
  annotations. Sets `/V` and `/AcroForm/NeedAppearances` (`/AP` regeneration is
  a follow-up). `PdfReader::trailer()` accessor added (#318).

### Fixed

- Text extraction dropped a whole page's content when that page's content
  stream contained a single malformed operator: the parser propagated the
  error and the extractor discarded every operator on the page. Parsing is now
  best-effort — a malformed operator is skipped and surrounding valid operators
  are kept; an unrecoverable tokenizer error keeps the tokens parsed so far
  instead of discarding the page (#319).
- Text drawn inside a Form XObject (invoked with `Do`) was never extracted.
  Producers such as RML2PDF/pluscode embed the page body as a Form XObject
  ("inclPDF"), so only the page's direct content was returned and the body went
  missing. The extractor now recurses into Form XObjects — composing their
  `/Matrix` onto the CTM, scoping their `/Resources` fonts, and handling nested
  XObjects with a depth guard. Validated across the full 9051-PDF corpus: zero
  regressions, 277 files recover previously-dropped text (#319).

## [2.14.0] - 2026-06-10

### Added

- Axial and radial gradients now render. Shadings emit a real PDF `/Function`
  built from their colour stops — Type 2 (exponential) for two stops, Type 3
  (stitching) for more — and the required `/ColorSpace`, with the function
  written as an indirect object. New paint path: `GraphicsContext::paint_shading`
  (the `sh` operator) plus `GraphicsContext::end_path` (the `n` operator) for
  terminating a clip path (`W n`). Previously shadings emitted a placeholder
  `/Function 1` integer, no `/ColorSpace`, and had no paint operator, so no
  viewer could render a registered gradient (#297).

### Fixed

- Dense and multi-column documents: word scramble from unresolved indirect
  `/Font` dictionaries, intra-line reordering of overlapping font-switched runs,
  missing inter-word spaces for Standard-14 fonts without `/Widths`, and `U+FFFD`
  from ToUnicode CMaps whose codespace length disagreed with their `bfchar`
  entries (#302, #305).
- `DocumentChunker::chunk_text` infinite loop on certain inputs (inverted
  progress guard, unbounded sentence-search window, degenerate config) (#308).
- `measure_text`/`measure_char` over-measured non-ASCII WinAnsi glyphs; the
  Core-14 metric tables now carry exact AFM widths for the 0x80–0xFF range, and
  `get_string_width` measures per character instead of per UTF-8 byte (#309,
  #313).

### Internal

- Examples are now compiled and verified in CI and gated in the release script
  (#303); community-health files added (#307).

## [2.13.0] - 2026-06-07

### Added

- Ruling-based (vector-grid) table detection wired into the partition pipeline:
  bordered tables are now reconstructed from the PDF's drawn grid (primary path),
  with the spatial detector handling the rest. Controlled by
  `PartitionConfig::prefer_ruling_tables` (default true). Cell-granular fragments
  are re-extracted only for pages with a drawn grid, so table-free documents pay
  no extra cost (#292).
- Per-chunk and document-level language detection for RAG chunks, behind the
  opt-in `language-detection` feature (pure-Rust `whatlang`). `ChunkMetadata`
  gains `language: Option<DetectedLanguage>` (ISO 639-3 code + confidence +
  reliability); enable via `DocumentChunker::with_language_detection(true)`.
  `DocumentChunker::document_language(&chunks)` returns the dominant language
  weighted by chunk length (#293).
- Image extraction now composites an image's `/SMask` (soft mask) as the alpha
  channel, emitting an RGBA PNG, instead of dropping it. Images whose visible
  shape lives entirely in the soft mask (e.g. logos over a flat-colour base)
  previously extracted as opaque rectangles (#286).
- Token-efficient chunk serialization for RAG output: `TokenEfficientExporter`
  emits a compact, round-trippable tabular format (`#oxct/1`, header once + one
  tab-separated row per chunk) that roughly halves the serialized-token count
  versus JSON, with `parse_chunks` to read it back. The new `ChunkExporter` trait
  unifies it with `JsonExporter` (both in `oxidize_pdf::ai`) (#291).

### Fixed

- Image extraction failed with `Image data too small: expected N, got 0` on
  legitimate highly-compressible images (e.g. flat-colour diagrams that reach
  DEFLATE's ~1032:1 maximum). The anti-decompression-bomb compression-ratio
  guard (1000:1) false-positived and the multi-strategy flate decoder masked the
  rejection by returning empty data; one such image early in a document also
  aborted the whole extraction batch. The ratio heuristic is now applied only
  above a large absolute output floor — the 256 MB absolute size cap remains the
  authoritative bomb guard (#286).

### Changed

- **MSRV raised to Rust 1.88** (from 1.77). The 2025 ecosystem migration to
  edition 2024 (Rust 1.85) plus `let`-chains (Rust 1.88, used by `subprocess`
  via `rusty-tesseract`) and 1.88-gated releases of `image`/`time` made the
  previously declared 1.77 unbuildable. Holding it would require pinning common
  dependencies (`image`, `time`, `clap`, `icu_*`, `rand`, `toml`, …) to old
  versions indefinitely. Added `resolver.incompatible-rust-versions = "fallback"`
  in `.cargo/config.toml` and a CI job that builds on 1.88 with `--locked` to
  prevent future silent MSRV drift.

## [2.12.0] - 2026-06-03

### Added

- `Page::add_icc_color_space(name, &IccProfile)` — register an ICC-profile-backed
  colour space that the writer emits as a conformant `/ICCBased` **stream**
  `[/ICCBased <ref>]` carrying the embedded profile bytes (ISO 32000-1 §8.6.5.5),
  closing the gap where ICC profiles registered as `PageColorSpace::Parameterised`
  were written as an inline dictionary with the profile data dropped (#282).
- `impl From<&CalGrayColorSpace>` / `From<&CalRgbColorSpace>` / `From<&LabColorSpace>`
  / `From<&IccProfile>` for `PageColorSpace`, plus `CalGrayColorSpace::params_dictionary`
  / `CalRgbColorSpace::params_dictionary` / `LabColorSpace::params_dictionary` — bridge
  typed calibrated/Lab/ICC colour-space structs directly into `Page::add_color_space`
  without hand-building a parameter `Dictionary` (#283).
- `PageColorSpace::IccStream` variant — stream-backed ICC colour space carrying the
  raw profile bytes, `N`, `Alternate`, and optional `Range`.
- Glyph-coverage diagnostics for embedded custom fonts: `Font::missing_glyphs`,
  `Document::font_missing_glyphs`, and `Document::embedded_font`. The Type0 writer now
  logs a warning naming a custom font and the characters it has no glyph for (they
  render as `.notdef`) instead of failing silently (#287).
- `ImagePreprocessingOptions` re-exported from `oxidize_pdf::operations` (#286).

### Fixed

- `ICCBased` colour spaces registered via the new `Page::add_icc_color_space` are now
  emitted as conformant indirect streams with the embedded profile, instead of an inline
  parameter dictionary that silently dropped the profile bytes (#282).
- Image extraction from `Indexed` colour-space images: the single palette index per
  pixel is expanded to the base colour via the palette (was mis-sized as 3-component
  RGB, producing `Image data too small`); the FlateDecode PNG predictor is applied when
  `/DecodeParms` is an indirect reference; and pages whose `/Resources` is an indirect
  reference are now resolved instead of falling back to a brute-force object scan (#286).

## [2.11.0] - 2026-05-30

### Added

- `GraphicsContext::set_fill_color_icc` / `set_stroke_color_icc` — draw with an
  ICC-based color space registered on the page via `Page::add_color_space`
  (`/Resources/ColorSpace/<name>`). The resource name is supplied by the caller
  because ICC profiles are named dynamically by `IccProfileManager`. Unblocks
  ICC color drawing in the .NET wrapper (GFX-019).
- `GraphicsContext::set_fill_color_calibrated_named` /
  `set_stroke_color_calibrated_named` / `set_fill_color_lab_named` /
  `set_stroke_color_lab_named` — calibrated and Lab color setters that accept a
  caller-supplied resource name, allowing multiple calibrated/Lab color spaces
  to coexist on one page. This removes the previous one-calibrated-space-per-page
  limitation; the existing `set_fill_color_calibrated`/`set_fill_color_lab`
  methods now delegate to these with the default `CalGray1`/`CalRGB1`/`Lab1`
  names, so existing behavior is unchanged.

### Fixed

- **Partitioner heading classification on tagged / tightly-spaced structured
  PDFs (#271).** The partitioner now consumes `TextFragment.struct_tag` (a new
  Step 0: `H`/`H1`..`H6`/`Title` → `Title`, `LI`/`Lbl`/`LBody` → `ListItem`),
  and Title detection gained two heuristics beyond font-size ratio: bold-short
  text and numeric/lettered section prefixes (`A2.a`, `3.1`, `Section 4:`,
  `IV.`) with strict guards. Flat single-level numbered markers (`1.`, `10)`)
  correctly yield to `ListItem` rather than `Title`. The Header zone detector
  gained a length cap and a body-tag gate so full paragraphs in the top page
  zone are no longer misclassified as `header`. On the NCSC CAF v4.0 corpus
  this turns 75 mislabeled long-text headers into 0 and 0 detected titles into
  57; ENS (Real Decreto 311/2022) goes from 3 to 107 titles.

## [2.10.0] - 2026-05-27

This release ships the text-extraction quality work merged to `develop`
since 2.9.0 (PRs #263, #264, #266, #267, #268, #270, #273, #274). The focus
is RAG-grade extraction correctness: non-Identity CID decoding, marked-content
semantics, paragraph reconstruction, and multi-column line ordering.

### Added

- **Non-Identity CID encoding decode for Type0 fonts (#272).** Character codes
  are resolved to CIDs through embedded `/Encoding` stream CMaps and predefined
  Adobe CMaps before mapping to Unicode, instead of assuming Identity. Vendored
  five Adobe CJK CMaps (GBK-EUC-H, GBKp-EUC-H, 90ms-RKSJ-H, 90pv-RKSJ-H,
  KSCms-UHC-H, BSD-3-Clause), algorithmic `Uni*` UTF-16BE handling, and external
  `usecmap` resolution to predefined UCS2 in `/ToUnicode`.
- **Marked-content extraction (#269).** `TextFragment` gains public `mcid:
  Option<u32>` and `struct_tag: Option<String>` fields carrying the innermost
  BDC ancestor's identity. `ExtractionOptions.include_artifacts` (default
  `false`) filters `/Artifact` subtrees; BDC/BMC/EMC operators are consumed and
  `/ActualText` overrides the marked run (UTF-16BE preserved).
- **Paragraph reconstruction (#261).** `ExtractionOptions.reconstruct_paragraphs`
  merges fragments into lines and paragraphs with hyphenation handling.
- **`ExtractionOptions.tj_space_threshold`** (default `0.2`) synthesises an
  implicit space when `TJ` kerning exceeds `threshold × font_size`, fixing
  run-on words in PDFs that emit one glyph per `(…)` array element (#272).
- **`rag_realworld` example (#266)** running `rag_chunks()` over a cached corpus
  of real government/academic PDFs, emitting RAG-ready JSONL per document.

### Fixed

- **Glyph-code-as-Latin1 garbage on CJK / government PDFs (#272).** Embedded and
  predefined encoding CMaps are now decoded; previously codes were treated as
  raw CIDs (Identity) and produced garbage (e.g. BOE `MINISTERIO` → ` 0 , 1 …`).
- **CMap parser hang and mis-parse on minified PostScript (#272).** Rewritten to
  a whitespace-agnostic token-based parser with a guaranteed progress invariant
  (no infinite loop on stray close delimiters in adversarial corpus input).
- **Line interleaving and column splitting on tightly-spaced multi-column
  layouts (#265).** `row_id`-aware `merge_into_lines`, font-size-relative Y
  tolerance, deferred sort, baseline tolerance tightened to `0.2 × height`, and
  a `font_size = 0` fallback.
- **CTM not composed into fragment positions (#262).** Text positions now
  account for the current transformation matrix; added a `q`/`Q` graphics-state
  stack.
- **Parser position leak (#260).** `peek_token` restores position on error and
  `find_keyword_ahead` no longer reads past the peek buffer.

### Compatibility

- New public fields were added to `TextFragment` and `ExtractionOptions`. Both
  structs are produced by the library and consumed via field access or
  `..Default::default()`, so the additions are non-breaking in practice; they
  are released as a minor per the project's versioning convention.

## [2.9.0] - 2026-05-20

### Changed

- **BREAKING (feature surface, not API).** `ocr-tesseract` is no longer in
  default features of `oxidize-pdf`. Users that relied on default-feature
  OCR must opt in explicitly:
  ```toml
  oxidize-pdf = { version = "2.9", features = ["ocr-tesseract"] }
  ```
  Rationale: `rusty-tesseract` invokes the Tesseract C binary at runtime,
  which contradicted the "no C dependencies" claim that the manifest has
  always made. Making OCR opt-in removes the contradiction. The OCR API
  surface (`OcrProvider`, `OcrEngine`, `MockOcrProvider`, `OcrResult`,
  `OcrOptions`) is exported unchanged; only `RustyTesseractProvider` is
  now feature-gated. Migration guidance is published at
  [Discussion #246](https://github.com/bzsanti/oxidizePdf/discussions/246).
- **`oxidize-pdf-core/Cargo.toml` `description`** rewritten as a RAG-first
  one-liner: *"Pure Rust PDF library for AI/RAG: structure-aware chunking
  with bounding boxes, heading context, and token estimates. No Python,
  no ML, no C bindings."* Reflects the project's actual differentiator at
  the level of `cargo add` / crates.io metadata.
- **`oxidize-pdf-core/Cargo.toml` `keywords`** switched from generic
  (`pdf-parser`, `text-extraction`, `pdf-generation`) to acquisition-
  oriented (`rag`, `chunking`, `ai`, `embeddings`). Five-keyword slot
  reallocated; redundant terms (`pdf-parser`/`pdf-generation` overlapped
  with `pdf`) removed.
- **`external-images` added to default features.** The pure-Rust `image`
  crate dependency that powers PNG/JPEG extraction is now in default
  features. It was previously only enabled transitively via
  `ocr-tesseract`. With OCR moving to opt-in, `external-images` becomes
  its own default-on feature so RAG pipelines that extract embedded
  images keep working out-of-the-box.

### Documentation

- **README and landing page demote the "Beyond RAG" feature catalogue.**
  The README section that previously showed five generation/encryption/
  signatures/operations code blocks now collapses to a single "Also in
  the box" paragraph + link to `oxidize-pdf-core/examples/` and
  `docs.rs`. The landing-page grid of six cards collapses similarly to a
  single paragraph. RAG one-liner stays as the hero. Features unchanged;
  presentation tightened.
- **Doc-test in `pdf_ocr_converter`** switched to use `MockOcrProvider`
  (always available) instead of `RustyTesseractProvider` (now feature-
  gated). The example still demonstrates the API; a leading sentence
  redirects readers to `ocr-tesseract` + `RustyTesseractProvider` for
  real OCR.

### Internal

- Examples requiring OCR (`tesseract_debug`, `convert_pdf_ocr`,
  `test_ocr_simple`) now declare `required-features = ["ocr-tesseract"]`
  so they are skipped when the feature is not enabled rather than
  failing to compile.

## [2.8.2] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed

- **crates.io / lib.rs categories** corrected for `oxidize-pdf-core`.
  The previous `categories = ["graphics", "text-processing", "parsing",
  "multimedia::images"]` listed an invalid slug (`"parsing"` — the
  correct one is `parser-implementations`) which crates.io silently
  dropped, and a semantically wrong slug (`"multimedia::images"`, meant
  for image codecs) which lib.rs surfaced as the primary display
  category. The crate now ships with
  `["parser-implementations", "text-processing", "graphics", "encoding"]`
  and refreshed keywords (`pdf`, `pdf-parser`, `text-extraction`,
  `pdf-generation`, `rag`). Addresses #241.
- **`Page::set_fill_color` (graphics) now affects subsequent text rendering**
  when no explicit text fill colour has been set. Per ISO 32000-1 §8.6.8,
  the `rg` operator sets the non-stroking colour of the graphics state,
  which applies to both path fills and glyph fills at text rendering
  mode 0 (default). Pre-fix, `GraphicsContext.current_color` and
  `TextContext.fill_color` were independent slots: a caller that drew a
  filled rectangle in magenta and then wrote text without an explicit
  text colour saw the glyphs painted in magenta (the last `rg` left in
  the stream) instead of the colour they had set via
  `graphics().set_fill_color(...)`. `Page::text()` and `Page::text_flow()`
  now inherit the current graphics-state non-stroking colour when the
  text context has no explicit colour of its own; an explicit
  `text().set_fill_color(...)` still overrides the inherited value.
  Addresses #239.
- **`TextFlowContext::write_wrapped` now encodes text through
  `TextEncoding::WinAnsiEncoding`** (matching `TextContext::write`),
  fixing multi-byte Unicode characters (e.g. `€`, `—`, `ñ`, smart
  quotes) being emitted as raw UTF-8 bytes that PDF viewers
  reinterpreted as Windows-1252 mojibake (`€` → `â‚¬`, `—` → `â€"`).
  Both `TextContext::write` and `TextFlowContext::write_wrapped` now
  delegate to a shared `text::build_show_text_op` helper so they cannot
  diverge again on encoding or escape rules per ISO 32000-1 §7.9.2 and
  §9.10.3 (Custom CJK fonts continue to use UTF-16BE hex; builtin fonts
  use WinAnsi + octal-escape literal strings). Addresses #240.

### Changed

- **Behavioural change in the emitted content stream** (no visual
  difference): pages that emit text without an explicit text fill
  colour now also emit the graphics-state default `0.000 g` (gray
  black) inside the surrounding `BT … ET` block. The text was already
  rendered in black via the inherited graphics state; the stream is now
  explicit about it. Tests that asserted absence of `rg` / `g` inside
  pure-text BT…ET blocks should be updated to assert presence of the
  expected colour operator instead.

### Internal

- `text::metrics::tests::test_create_default_custom_metrics_is_cached`
  rewritten from a timing-based assertion (`< 50ms` for 1000 calls,
  observed at 74–84ms under full-suite parallelism with the unoptimised
  test profile) to a call-counter (`AtomicUsize` incremented by
  `build_default_custom_metrics` under `#[cfg(test)]`, asserting
  `delta <= 1` after 1000 calls). Load-invariant and deterministic.

## [2.8.1] - 2026-05-17

### Fixed

- **`Document::add_page`** now also injects the per-Document
  `FontMetricsStore` into `page.text_context.font_metrics_store` when the
  page was constructed via `Page::a4()` / `Page::letter()` /
  `Page::new(...)`. Before this fix, only `page.font_metrics_store` was set;
  the text context was left with `font_metrics_store: None` and any
  subsequent measurement through the page's text context fell through to
  the legacy global registry, re-introducing the cross-`Document` leak that
  issue #230 was meant to close architecturally. Pages constructed via
  `Document::new_page_*()` were unaffected (the factory path already wired
  both fields). The fix mutates only the `font_metrics_store` field on the
  existing `TextContext`, preserving any operations the caller pushed
  before `add_page`. Issue #230 follow-up M1.
- Text extraction in `preserve_layout` mode now emits `TextFragment` for
  `TJ` (`ShowTextArray`), `'` (`NextLineShowText`), and `"`
  (`SetSpacingNextLineShowText`) operators — not only for `Tj`
  (`ShowText`). Previously, PDFs whose body relied on `TJ` (typical for
  LaTeX, InDesign, and modern Word output) yielded zero fragments per
  page, causing the partitioner to receive zero elements and
  `Document::rag_chunks()` to return an empty vector. Addresses #235.
- The `'` and `"` text-show operators were previously swallowed by the
  catch-all match arm in `TextExtractor::extract_from_page`, leaving
  their text out of `ExtractedText::text` and out of
  `ExtractedText::fragments`. Both now advance the line matrix by
  `-leading`, emit text into both buffers, and (for `"`) apply the
  embedded word- and character-spacing values to the text state.

### Changed

- New cargo feature `internal-testing` (off by default) gates the
  `Page::text_context_*_for_test` introspection helpers used by the #230
  follow-up integration tests, keeping them out of the production ABI.
  CI runs `cargo test --all --features internal-testing` so the gated
  tests still execute.

## [2.8.0] - 2026-05-09

### Added

- **`FontMetricsStore`** in `text::metrics` — per-`Document` custom font
  metrics store. Cheap-to-clone (Arc-backed), bounded by `Document`
  lifetime, resolves cross-`Document` leaks and last-writer-wins races
  on the process-wide registry. See issue #230.
- **`Document::new_page_a4()`**, **`new_page_letter()`**,
  **`new_page(width, height)`** — factory methods that produce a `Page`
  already bound to the Document's metrics store. Recommended path for
  any code using custom fonts.
- **`Document::font_metrics()`** and **`Document::pages()`** public
  accessors. **`Page::font_metrics_store()`** read-only accessor for
  the page-level binding.
- **`measure_text_with(text, &Font, size, Option<&FontMetricsStore>)`**,
  **`measure_char_with(...)`**, **`measure_text_block_with(...)`** —
  scope-aware variants of the existing measurement helpers.
- **`ComboBox::with_default_appearance(font, size, color)`** — typed `/DA` builder mirroring `TextField::with_default_appearance`. `FormManager::add_combo_box` now propagates the typed `DefaultAppearance` to `FormField.default_appearance`, so `Document::fill_field` on a `Choice` field can dispatch to the Type0/CID custom-font path. Without this, fill_field on a ComboBox fell through to the Helvetica + WinAnsi path and returned `PdfError::EncodingError` for any non-WinAnsi value (addresses #212).
- **`ListBoxAppearance::generate_appearance_with_font(widget, value, state, custom_font)`** — Type0/CID-aware appearance generator, matching the existing pattern on `TextFieldAppearance` and `ComboBoxAppearance`. Dispatches on `(font.is_custom(), custom_font)` to emit hex-CID Tj operators and a Type0 placeholder resource entry for custom fonts; the legacy `AppearanceGenerator::generate_appearance` now delegates to it with `custom_font = None` (addresses #212).

### Changed

- **`Document::add_font_from_bytes`** now stores measurement metrics in
  the per-Document `FontMetricsStore` instead of the process-wide global
  registry. Public signature unchanged. Existing callers benefit
  automatically: metrics now die with the `Document`.
- **`Document::add_page(page)`** injects the Document's metrics store
  into the page if the page does not already carry one. Pages
  constructed via `Document::new_page_*()` already carry a store and
  are not overwritten (preserves bindings if a page was constructed
  against a different Document).
- Custom font lookup in measurement helpers no longer auto-registers
  default metrics on read miss. Read paths are now pure reads; misses
  log a single rate-limited warning per name and return default widths
  without persisting anything.

### Deprecated

- **`text::metrics::register_custom_font_metrics(name, metrics)`** —
  use `Document::add_font_from_bytes`. The function continues to work
  (writes to the legacy global registry) but emits a deprecation
  warning at call sites. Long-running services should migrate to the
  per-Document path.
- **`text::metrics::get_custom_font_metrics(name)`** — same rationale.

### Fixed

- Resolves issue #230: process-wide `CUSTOM_FONT_METRICS` registry
  leaked metrics across `Document` lifetimes, enabling memory growth
  and cross-document name collisions in long-running services.
- Side fix: the read path no longer plants default metrics in the
  global registry on unknown `Font::Custom(name)` lookups.
- **`PushButtonAppearance` with `Font::Custom(_)`** unconditionally emitted `/Subtype /Type1` in the AP `/Resources/Font` dict and called `emit_tj_for_builtin` on the label (which rejects custom fonts with `PdfError::EncodingError`), so push buttons with CJK / non-WinAnsi fonts could not be generated at all. The resource dict now emits a `/Subtype /Type0` placeholder for custom fonts (rewritten to an indirect Reference at write time by `rewrite_ap_stream_font_resources`), and the label-render block is skipped when the font is custom — the hex-CID Tj path for push button labels remains a follow-up because the generator does not yet take a `custom_font` parameter (addresses #212).
- **ComboBox `/AP/N` for `Font::Custom`** now correctly emits hex-CID Tj content and a Type0 resource placeholder via `Document::fill_field`. This completes the v2.6.0 partial fix (PR #215) which addressed encoding for built-in WinAnsi values; the architectural Type0/CID path now works end-to-end for `FieldType::Text` and `FieldType::Choice` (addresses #212).

## [2.7.0] - 2026-05-07

### Added

- **Typed content-stream IR** (`graphics::ops::Op` + `serialize_ops`) replacing the per-context `String` buffers in `GraphicsContext`, `TextContext`, and `TextFlowContext`. Internal refactor; prepares the codebase for editor-mode workflows and future optimisation passes. `Op::Raw(Vec<u8>)` is the escape hatch for emitters not yet migrated.
- **`TextFlowContext` text-state setters** (closes #222): `set_character_spacing`, `set_word_spacing`, `set_horizontal_scaling`, `set_leading`, `set_text_rise`, `set_rendering_mode`, `set_stroke_color`. Mirror of the corresponding `TextContext` API. `Page::text_flow()` now propagates the full set of nine text-state parameters from the page-level `TextContext` into the derived flow context (PR #219 covered three; this release covers the remaining seven).

### Fixed

- **Painter-model call order** preserved across `Page::graphics()` / `Page::text()` / `Page::add_text_flow()` / `Page::append_raw_content()` calls (closes #227). Pre-2.7.0, `generate_content_with_page_info` flushed the entire graphics buffer before the entire text buffer (and `add_text_flow` content always last from `self.content`), regardless of caller order. The fix is a flush-on-borrow sentinel: every public method that emits content drains the pending graphics + text tails into a unified `page_ops` buffer first, so the timeline stays monotonic by call.
- **Non-finite floats sanitised in the typed IR** (extends the 2.6.0 colour fix, issues #220 / #221). Every numeric operator emitted through `GraphicsContext`, `TextContext`, and `TextFlowContext` routes through `finite_or_zero` at the emission boundary: path coords (`m`, `l`, `c`, `re`), line widths (`w`), miter limits (`M`), flatness (`i`), transforms (`cm`), text positioning (`Td`), font size (`Tf`), text-state operators (`Tc`, `Tw`, `Tz`, `TL`, `Ts`), and dash-pattern arrays / phase (`d`). **Out of scope for v2.7.0**: `forms/appearance.rs`, `forms/signature_widget.rs`, `forms/signature_field.rs`, `annotations/annotation_type.rs::FreeTextAnnotation::with_font`, `annotations/geometric.rs`, `layout/rich_text.rs`, `writer/pdf_writer/mod.rs` field appearances, and the `Op::Raw` / `GraphicsContext::add_command` escape hatches still emit caller-supplied `f64` verbatim. Non-finite values passed to those APIs will produce ISO 32000-1-non-conformant content streams; tracked for v2.8 / v3.0 migration. Same threat model and severity as the original colour fix (improper output validation, not DoS).

### Changed

- **API surface (semver patch-compat for callers using only documented methods)**:
  - `GraphicsContext::operations()` and `get_operations()` now return owned `String` instead of `&str`. Internally the buffer is `Vec<Op>` and serialisation is on demand. Callers who borrowed the legacy `&str` need a `&` (e.g. `count_tj(&ops)`).
  - `TextContext::operations()` follows the same change.
  - `TextFlowContext::operations()` follows the same change.
  - `Page::graphics_operations()` follows the same change.
- **`cm` matrix format**: every slot is now emitted at `{:.2}` consistently. Pre-2.7.0 the identity slots were integer literals (`1 0 0 1 …`) and rotation used `{:.6}`. The new wire form is `1.00 0.00 0.00 1.00 …` and `{:.2}` for rotation. PDF-conformant in both forms; pure cosmetic for downstream consumers, but tests asserting byte-exact `cm` output need updating.
- **Justified-line `Tw` reset** in `TextFlowContext::write_wrapped` is now emitted as `0.00 Tw` (was `0 Tw`). Same wire semantics, normalised to the IR's `{:.2}` precision.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-05-04

Bundle release closing six issues across forms, text-flow state, table rendering, and graphics colour emission. Includes one security hardening (CWE-20: NaN/inf bypass in colour content-stream emission, public-issue #220) plus its companion refactor #221 establishing a single source of truth for every colour-operator emission across the codebase.

### Security
- **Sanitize non-finite floats in colour content-stream emission** (addresses #220). Direct construction of `Color::Rgb(f64::NAN, ...)` (and the `Gray`/`Cmyk` variants — they are public tuple-struct variants) bypasses the clamping in `Color::rgb`/`gray`/`cmyk` constructors. Without sanitisation at the emission boundary, the `{:.3}` formatter wrote literal `NaN` / `inf` / `-inf` tokens to the content stream — ISO 32000-1 §7.3.3 rejects those as numeric values, so conformant viewers reject the entire content stream (availability DoS via crafted input). Every colour emitter in the codebase (~50 sites across 17 files) now routes through a sanitising helper that substitutes `0.0` for non-finite components. Includes the 4 sites listed explicitly in #220 plus all sibling emitters that were vulnerable to the same CWE class — `text/`, `graphics/`, `forms/` (appearance, button_widget, choice_widget, field_appearance, field_type, signature_field, signature_widget), `annotations/`, `layout/`, `writer/`. Note: a broader follow-up will extend the same discipline to non-colour numeric content-stream emitters (line widths, transform matrices, dash patterns, `Td`, `m`, `l`, `c`, `re`) — same CWE class, separate issue tracked for the next minor release.

### Added
- **`graphics::color::{fill_color_op, stroke_color_op}`** (`pub(crate)`, addresses #221) — single source of truth returning the non-stroking / stroking colour-operator string without trailing newline. Used by `forms/field_type.rs::DefaultAppearance::to_da_string` (annotation `/DA`), `graphics/patterns.rs` tile commands, and `graphics/form_xobject.rs` operation buffers.
- **`graphics::color::{write_fill_color, write_stroke_color}`** (`pub(crate)`) — direct emission to `&mut String` content-stream buffers via `std::fmt::Write` (no intermediate allocation).
- **`graphics::color::{write_fill_color_bytes, write_stroke_color_bytes}`** (`pub(crate)`) — direct emission to `&mut Vec<u8>` content-stream buffers via `std::io::Write` (no intermediate allocation). Used by form-widget appearance generators.
- **`graphics::color::finite_or_zero`** (`pub(crate)`) — substitutes `NaN`, `+inf`, `-inf` with `0.0`; finite values pass through unchanged including out-of-range (the renderer is responsible for value-range clamping; this helper exists strictly to keep the wire format syntactically valid).
- **`Page::text_flow()` now propagates page-level text state** into the new `TextFlowContext` (addresses #216). `font`, `font_size`, and (when set) `fill_color` configured via `Page::text().set_font(...)` / `set_fill_color(...)` are now inherited by `text_flow()` instead of being silently dropped. Affects the Python `Page.text_flow_at` and the .NET `oxidize_text_flow_create` callers — wrapped text now respects the page-level text state. `TextFlowContext` gains a `fill_color: Option<Color>` field with public setter and per-line emission.
- **`TableStyle::header_font: Option<Font>`** and **`TableStyle::header_bold: Option<bool>`** (addresses #217). Optional overrides for header typography; both default to `None`, in which case the legacy hardcoded `Font::Helvetica` + `bold: true` apply. The `add_styled_table` header-style gate now also fires on either of these so `TableStyle::minimal()` / `simple()` callers can override typography without having to also set a background colour.
- **`TableStyle::with_header_font(font)`** and **`TableStyle::with_header_bold(bold)`** chainable setters for ergonomic preset overrides: `TableStyle::professional().with_header_font(Font::TimesRoman)`.
- **`Table::render_with_split(graphics, bottom_y) -> Result<Option<Table>, PdfError>`** (addresses #218). Primitive renderer: renders the leading rows that fit above `bottom_y`; returns `Some(tail)` carrying the unrendered rows (same `column_widths` / `options`, position sentinel `(start_x, 0.0)`) or `None` if everything fitted.
- **`Table::render_strict(graphics, bottom_y) -> Result<(), PdfError>`** — pre-flight overflow check; returns `PdfError::TableOverflow { rendered, dropped, bottom_y }` without drawing anything if any row would overflow.
- **`DocumentTables::add_paginated_table(...)`** — new trait on `Document` that allocates continuation pages and re-renders the tail of an oversized table, optionally repeating the header rows on each continuation page (`TableOptions::repeat_header_on_split`, defaults to `true`).
- **`PdfError::TableOverflow { rendered: usize, dropped: usize, bottom_y: f64 }`** — new variant emitted by `render_strict` and `add_paginated_table` when forward progress stalls.
- **48 new content-verifying integration tests** across the bundle (no smoke tests):
  - `tests/issue_220_color_emission_sanitization_test.rs` — 19 tests covering NaN/inf sanitisation across `TextContext`, `TextFlowContext`, `GraphicsContext`, patterns, `FormXObject`, `FreeText` `/DA`, and `field_appearance` text fields.
  - `tests/issue_217_tablestyle_header_typography_test.rs` — 11 tests covering preset defaults, override behaviour (Times-Bold, non-bold Helvetica, Courier-Bold, Helvetica-Oblique pass-through), preset chaining, and the gate for typography-only overrides.
  - `tests/table_pagination_test.rs` — 13 tests for the three new pagination APIs plus security regression guards (header-heavy DoS forward-progress check, NaN/inf rejection in `bottom_y` / `next_page_y`).
  - `tests/text_flow_inherits_page_state_test.rs` — 5 tests guarding state propagation + explicit override semantics.
- 13 new unit tests in `graphics/color.rs` for the helper itself (`finite_or_zero` for the four edge cases, `write_fill_color` / `write_stroke_color` for each variant + sanitisation, parity assertion between fill and stroke operators).

### Fixed
- **`Document::fill_field` now correctly encodes non-WinAnsi values** (addresses #212). The fix path always emitted the widget `/AP/N` with `Helvetica` + raw UTF-8 bytes inside a `(...) Tj` operator. Viewers honouring `/AP` (`NeedAppearances=false`) then interpreted those bytes as WinAnsi, silently corrupting any non-WinAnsi value — Latin-extended (é ñ ü ç), CJK, Arabic, Hebrew. Concrete reproductions: `fill_field("name", "café")` previously rendered as `cafÃ©`; `fill_field("name", "高效能")` rendered as 9 random WinAnsi glyphs. Post-fix the writer routes WinAnsi-encodable values through the strict WinAnsi encoder (Type1 path) and non-WinAnsi values through the registered custom font's glyph map (Type0/CID path), with the appearance stream emitting hex-encoded CIDs `<HHHH>` for the latter.
- **`PageTables::add_styled_table` now correctly marks the header row as a header** (addresses #217). The convenience method previously appended the headers via `add_row`, which sets `is_header: false`. The `Table::render` path then skipped the configured `HeaderStyle` entirely (`use_header_style = row.is_header && …`) and the header was drawn with the default data-row font. Calling `add_header_row` instead applies the configured `HeaderStyle` as documented. Visible rendering change for `TableStyle::professional()` and `TableStyle::colorful()` callers: the header row now renders in `Helvetica-Bold` (the `HeaderStyle` default) rather than plain `Helvetica`.

### Changed
- **Wire-format consolidation: every colour emitter now uses `.3`-precision uniformly** (consequence of the #220 / #221 single-source-of-truth refactor). Some sites previously used unformatted `{}` (default Rust `f64` formatting). The wire form is more consistent and slightly more verbose (~5 chars per operator) but ISO 32000-1-conformant in every case.
- **Behaviour change in `forms/choice_widget.rs`**: the previous emitter forced RGB output via `Color::r()` / `g()` / `b()` lossy conversion regardless of the colour's native space. The new shared helper emits the native space (`rg` for RGB, `g` for Gray, `k` for CMYK) which is strictly more correct. PDF/A consumers that relied on the implicit RGB normalisation should verify their output intent now references DeviceCMYK if needed.
- **`Table::render` semantics unchanged for back-compat** (addresses #218). The legacy renderer still silently overflows past `page_bottom = 0.0` for 2.x consumers — the new `render_with_split` / `render_strict` / `add_paginated_table` are the correct entry points for callers who need vertical-overflow handling. A regression test (`render_back_compat_silently_overflows_unchanged`) locks the legacy behaviour.

## [2.5.7] - 2026-04-23

Single-fix patch release for the font subsetter, plus hardening of the internal content-stream API to prevent the same class of silent regression.

### Fixed
- **Per-font character tracking for subsetting** (reported in issue #204 by @sparkyandrew). `Document.used_characters` was a single `HashSet<char>` shared across every registered custom font, so the writer subsetted every font with the same global character set. Two fonts from the same family (user's report: `SourceHanSansTC-Regular` + `SourceHanSansTC-Bold`) — even when only one was referenced via `set_font` — both ended up with ~200-glyph subsets, roughly doubling the emitted PDF size. Tracking is now per-font via `HashMap<String, HashSet<char>>` at every layer (`GraphicsContext`, `TextContext`, `TextFlowContext`, `Page`, `Document`, `PdfWriter`). Fonts registered via `add_font_from_bytes` but never referenced from any content stream are skipped entirely.
- **`RichText::render_operations` now reports its per-font character usage** to the caller. Previously the `FlowLayout::RichText` path fed content directly into the page via `append_raw_content` without tracking which fonts were referenced — post-#204 fix, that would silently drop any custom font used only in a `RichText` span. The method now returns `(String, HashMap<String, HashSet<char>>)` and `FlowLayout::build_into` plumbs the map through.
- **`TextFlowContext` and `Page::add_text_flow` now track per-font character usage**. `TextFlowContext::write_wrapped` records chars under the active font's name; `Page::add_text_flow` absorbs the map via the new `GraphicsContext::merge_font_usage`. Previously chars drawn through `DocumentBuilder::add_text(_, Font::Custom(_), _)` bypassed all tracking.
- **`Page::set_header` / `Page::set_footer` eagerly register the header/footer font** + sampled template characters. Header/footer rendering happens at writer time, after the document's per-font snapshot is frozen, so any custom font referenced ONLY from a header would otherwise disappear from the output. The fix renders the template with canonical sample values (`page_number=1`, `total_pages=999`) and adds the digit range `0..=9` to cover runtime-varying page numbers. Known limitation: user-supplied `custom_values` not present in the template literal are not pre-tracked (callers needing that should draw the same font somewhere on the page body).

### Changed
- **`Page::append_raw_content(data)` → `Page::append_raw_content(data, font_usage)`** (type-gated `pub(crate)` API). Every caller that splices raw bytes into the page content stream must now report which fonts it referenced and which characters it drew. The signature change is deliberate: it makes R1/R4-class silent bypasses (content-stream builders forgetting to update tracking) impossible to reintroduce — new call sites fail to compile without providing the map. Because the method is `pub(crate)`, this is not a SemVer break.
- **`FormManager::iter_fields_sorted`** continues to return a flat iterator (`impl Iterator<Item = (&String, &FormField, ObjectReference)>`) — no change this release, noted for release-notes completeness.

### Added
- 6 content-verifying integration tests in `tests/per_font_char_tracking_test.rs` (no smoke tests): `unused_font_is_absent_from_resources` (the exact user scenario), `unused_latin_font_absent_when_cjk_used`, `both_fonts_present_when_both_used`, `rich_text_with_custom_font_embeds_font`, `text_flow_with_custom_font_embeds_font`, `header_only_custom_font_embeds_font`.
- Updated `RichText::render_operations` unit test to lock the `(ops, font_usage)` contract.

### Known limitations
- **Form field /AP streams with custom Type0 fonts** (tracked in issue #212). `forms/appearance.rs` hard-codes `/Subtype /Type1 /BaseFont <name>` in the self-contained `/Resources/Font` of every widget appearance. Works for the base-14 builtin fonts; produces an invalid PDF for custom CIDFontType0 fonts even after the #204 fix because the widget /AP references the font under the wrong subtype and uses literal `(...) Tj` rather than hex-encoded CIDs. The document-level font is embedded correctly — only the widget's appearance is broken. Requires an architectural change to the appearance generator (late-binding font references or moving generation to write-time); deferred to #212.

## [2.5.6] - 2026-04-23

This release closes the v2.5.6 gap-closing series (surfaced by the `oxidize-pdf-dotnet` wrapper audit — features whose machinery existed in the graphics / forms / catalog layer but whose wire format never reached the PDF) plus the full set of 11 findings from the post-release `quality-rust` + `security-expert-advisor` review of that work. Two security-relevant hardening fixes land here: PDF-string escape and resource-name validation.

### Security
- **`Object::String` now escapes `\`, `(`, `)` before writing** (ISO 32000-1 §7.3.4.2). Prior to this fix the writer emitted raw bytes inside `(...)` so a caller-supplied value containing `)` could close the string early and inject arbitrary dict keys into the enclosing object. Reachable from `Document::fill_field` and every `/Info`-metadata setter. **(SEC-F1)**
- **`Page::add_color_space` / `add_pattern` / `add_shading` / `add_form_xobject` now validate the supplied resource name** against ISO 32000-1 §7.3.5 (no whitespace, no delimiter characters `( ) < > [ ] { } / %`, no `#` escape introducer). A caller-controlled name containing delimiters used to produce a `/Name` token that prematurely closed the resource dict — a dict-level injection parallel to F1. Invalid names are now rejected with `PdfError::InvalidStructure`. **(SEC-F5)**
- **`Document::fill_field` now clears `/AP` when the rect-fallback path is taken instead of silently reusing a stale appearance for widget 0.** Combined with `/NeedAppearances true` this ensures viewers regenerate the appearance rather than rendering a stale one. **(SEC-F3)**

### Added
- **`Page::add_color_space`, `add_pattern`, `add_shading` registries + writer emission** (ISO 32000-1 §8.6, §8.7.3, §8.7.4). The graphics layer already modelled `CalRGB`/`ICCBased`/`TilingPattern`/`AxialShading`/`RadialShading` with full `to_pdf_dictionary()` serialisers, but `Page` had no registry and the writer emitted no `/Resources/ColorSpace`, `/Resources/Pattern` or `/Resources/Shading` — content-stream operators like `/CS1 cs` / `/P1 scn` / `/Sh1 sh` were unresolvable from external code. Patterns and shadings are emitted as indirect objects; colour spaces inline as a direct sub-dict. Writer blocks honour the preserved-resources precedence rule used by `/Font` and `/XObject`.
- **`Page::add_form_xobject` and `Page::form_xobjects` promoted to `pub`**. The in-memory registry was already populated by overlay code paths but could not be reached from external callers. Rustdoc + doctest added; the `/Group` wire format is guarded by a new integration test file (`tests/formxobject_group_test.rs`) asserting `/Type /Group`, `/S /Transparency`, `/CS`, `/I`, `/K` per ISO 32000-1 §11.6.6 Table 147.
- **`ExtGState` now emits `/BM` (blend mode) and `/SMask` (soft mask)**. Both fields had long been populated by the public builder API (`with_blend_mode`, `set_soft_mask`, `set_soft_mask_none`) but the writer dropped them, so transparency composition was silently broken. `/BM` is written as `Object::Name` via `BlendMode::pdf_name()` (single-name form; array/fallback form §11.3.5 not yet exposed). `/SMask` is written via `SoftMask::to_pdf_dictionary()` — including the `/Type /Mask /S /None` dict form for "disable inherited soft mask".
- **`Document::fill_field(name, value)`** — machine-readable `/V` + regenerated widget appearance stream in one call (ISO 32000-1 §12.7.3.3 Table 228).
- **New typed `PageColorSpace` enum** in `graphics::page_color_space` with `DeviceAlias(DeviceColorSpace)` and `Parameterised { family: ParameterisedFamily, params: Dictionary }` variants. Marked `#[non_exhaustive]` so Indexed/Separation/DeviceN can land later as a SemVer-compatible superset. See the Changed section below.
- **`Object::ByteString(Vec<u8>)`** variant for binary payloads emitted as PDF hex `<AABB…>` — the correct encoding for /U, /O, /UE, /OE, /ID entries written by the encryption path.
- **18 integration tests + 8 unit tests** for AES-128 R4 key derivation per ISO 32000-1 §7.6.2 Algorithm 1.
- **Roman-numeral page-label regression suite**: four content-verifying tests guarding case consistency between `PageLabelStyle::format()` and `to_pdf_name()`, plus writer-side scans of the emitted PDF bytes.

### Fixed
- **Roman-numeral page label style now uses the correct case per ISO 32000-1 §12.4.2 Table 159** — `PageLabelStyle::UppercaseRoman` now emits `/S /R` and `PageLabelStyle::LowercaseRoman` emits `/S /r`. Prior to this fix the mapping was inverted in both directions: `to_pdf_name()` wrote the opposite case and `PageLabelTree::from_dict()` read it back with the same inversion, so internal round-trips appeared to work but any spec-conforming viewer (Acrobat, Foxit, etc.) rendered the opposite case of what the Rust API promised (e.g. `roman_uppercase()` produced PDFs shown as "i, ii, iii"). Also affected behaviour: reading PDFs written by other tools — a document that correctly carried `/S /R` was parsed back as `LowercaseRoman`. Non-Roman styles (`D`, `A`, `a`) were already correct.
- **SoftMask `/G` is now emitted as an indirect `Reference`, not an inline `Name`** (ISO 32000-1 §11.6.5.2 Table 146). The previous `Name` form was a spec violation that viewers either rejected or rendered incorrectly. The regression test (`extgstate_emits_smask_alpha_dict_with_group_reference`) used to tolerate either shape — a permissiveness that masked the original bug — and now strictly asserts `Reference`. **(F2)**
- **Resource-dictionary entries (`/Font`, `/XObject`, `/ColorSpace`, `/Pattern`, `/Shading`, `/ExtGState`) are emitted in deterministic, ASCII-lexicographic order** so two logically-identical documents serialise to byte-identical PDFs. Previously the writer iterated `HashMap`s whose iteration order is randomised per-instance, making reproducible builds and PDF diffs impossible. Sorting happens at `Dictionary` write time, independent of insertion order. **(QUAL-9)**
- **`Annotation::to_dict` defensively skips `/Parent` for non-Widget annotations** even if `set_field_parent` was called by mistake. Matches the `debug_assert!` in the setter — defence in depth. **(QUAL-2)**

### Changed
- **`Page::add_color_space` now takes `PageColorSpace` instead of `crate::objects::Object`.** The prior signature leaked an internal serialization type across the public API — a SemVer-fragile cliff. `Page::color_spaces()` likewise returns `&HashMap<String, PageColorSpace>`. The writer converts to the concrete `Object::Name` / `Object::Array` form at emit time via `PageColorSpace::to_object()`, so any future wire-format change (e.g. ICCBased streams) is a single-file edit. **SemVer-breaking** — pre-release v2.5.6 was not published to crates.io, so no users outside the development branch are affected. **(QUAL-5)**
- **`FormManager::iter_fields_sorted` now returns `impl Iterator<Item = (&String, &FormField, ObjectReference)>` (no `Result` wrapper).** Both prior error arms were "can't happen" invariants upheld by `add_*_field`; a broken invariant now panics with a descriptive message (the writer has no meaningful recovery path for corrupted internal state). `pub(crate)` only — no public API impact. **(QUAL-6)**
- **`Annotation::set_field_parent` rustdoc now includes a `# Panics` section** documenting the debug-build `debug_assert!` on non-Widget annotations and the release-build defence-in-depth path through `to_dict`. **(QUAL-4/10/11)**

### Impact
- The C# wrapper `oxidize-pdf-dotnet` (and any other binding) can now expose colour-space / pattern / shading / form-xobject / blend-mode / soft-mask features that previously had no wire-format path out of the graphics layer.
- Two security-relevant injection vectors (SEC-F1, SEC-F5) are closed. Callers that ingested untrusted strings via `fill_field` or constructed resource names from user input no longer risk breaking out of the enclosing dict.
- Byte-reproducible builds are now practical: resource dicts emit in deterministic order (QUAL-9).

## [2.5.5] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed
- **`/OpenAction` now reaches the PDF catalog** — `Document::set_open_action()` was stored on the document but `write_catalog()` in `pdf_writer/mod.rs` never serialised it (ISO 32000-1 §7.7.2 Table 28). Now emitted as an inline action dictionary via `Action::to_dict()`.
- **`/ViewerPreferences` now reaches the PDF catalog** — same bug class as `/OpenAction`. The preference dictionary (HideToolbar, PageLayout, Direction, etc.) was built by `Document::set_viewer_preferences()` but dropped on write (ISO 32000-1 §7.7.2 Table 28, §12.2). Now emitted as an inline dictionary via `ViewerPreferences::to_dict()`.
- **`/Names` (named destinations) now reaches the PDF catalog** — `Document::set_named_destinations()` stored a `NamedDestinations` wrapper but the catalog never referenced it, so no reader could resolve named destinations (ISO 32000-1 §7.7.2 Table 28, §7.7.4 Table 31, §12.3.2.3). The writer now emits the name tree and a Name Dictionary as indirect objects and references the Name Dictionary from `/Names`.
- **`/PageLabels` now reaches the PDF catalog** — `Document::set_page_labels()` stored a `PageLabelTree` but the catalog never referenced it, so custom page numbering was dropped (ISO 32000-1 §7.7.2 Table 28, §12.4.2). The number tree is now written as an indirect object.
- **Page label dictionaries emit `/S` (numbering style) per spec** — `PageLabel::to_dict()` previously emitted the style under `/Type` (e.g. `/Type /D`). Per ISO 32000-1 §12.4.2 Table 159 the numbering style shall be carried by `/S`; `/Type`, when present, shall be the constant name `PageLabel`. The writer now emits `/Type /PageLabel` + `/S /<style>`, so conforming viewers actually recognise the numbering style. `PageLabel::from_dict()` prefers `/S` and tolerates legacy `/Type`-carrying-style dicts for backward-compatible round-trip.
- **`HybridChunker::chunk()` now emits element-disjoint chunks** — the chunker was accumulating content across emissions: any flush (type boundary, `merge_adjacent=false`, or size overflow) re-injected the just-flushed elements back into the working buffer via the `overlap_tokens` branch of `flush_buffer`. The consequence was that each emitted chunk contained a prefix of the previous chunk. For a one-page document with a title followed by three paragraphs the chunker produced `[title]` and `[title, p1, p2, p3]` instead of a single merged chunk (or two disjoint chunks). This made `PdfDocument::rag_chunks()` output unusable for vector-store ingestion: content was duplicated quadratically in document size. `flush_buffer` now empties the buffer unconditionally and never reinjects elements. Element-level overlap was incompatible with the RAG disjointness invariant; the `overlap_tokens` config field is preserved for API compatibility but is currently a no-op (reserved for a future text-level overlap implementation).
- Hardened three previously shape-only chunker tests (`test_overlap_chunks_preserve_heading_context`, `test_hybrid_chunk_with_graph_splits_large_section`, `test_hybrid_chunk_with_graph_handles_preamble`) to assert pairwise chunk-text disjointness and that each source paragraph appears in exactly one chunk.

### Added
- `src/writer/pdf_writer/tests/catalog_entries_tests.rs` — 5 content-verifying TDD tests that serialise a real `Document` and assert each catalog entry (plus the characteristic payload: `/S /GoTo`, `/HideToolbar true`, `(target)` name tree key, `/S /D`) reaches the PDF bytes. Includes a combined-entry regression guarding against future refactors that could drop one entry while keeping the others.
- `tests/hybrid_chunker_disjoint_test.rs` — four regression scenarios covering the accumulating-chunks bug: title+paragraphs under default config, size-overflow flushes, `merge_adjacent=false` with `overlap_tokens>0`, and an end-to-end PDF generated programmatically, parsed back, and chunked via `rag_chunks()`.

### Impact
The C# wrapper `oxidize-pdf-dotnet` (and any other binding) can now expose these four catalog features; previously the setters accepted values that were silently discarded during serialisation. RAG consumers of `PdfDocument::rag_chunks()` (`oxidize-python`, `llama-index-readers-oxidize-pdf`) will produce correct, non-duplicating chunk output for vector stores.

## [2.5.4] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed
- **TTF subset `post` table no longer copies glyph names** (#165) — `truetype_subsetter` was embedding the original font's `post` v2.0 table verbatim, which for CJK fonts carries ~370 KB of Pascal-string glyph names that PDF never consults (ToUnicode + CIDToGIDMap drive rendering). Subsets now always emit a 32-byte `post` v3.0 header, preserving the italic/underline/memory metrics from the original.
- **CIDToGIDMap stream now FlateDecode-compressed** (#165) — The Type0/CIDFontType2 glyph-index map was written as a raw uncompressed stream. It is dimensioned to the highest codepoint in use and is mostly zeros, so Flate compression shrinks it by 95-99%. For CJK documents a 131 KB map becomes ~340 bytes.

### Impact
Measured on the user's reported snippet with `SourceHanSansTC-Regular.ttf` (33 MB):

| Release | PDF size | vs krilla (48 KB) |
|---|---|---|
| v2.5.3 | 145 KB | +203 % |
| **v2.5.4** | **19 KB** | **-60 % (smaller)** |

The two fixes are independent and compound: the CJK TTF case drops from 145 KB to 19 KB, the Roboto Latin TTF case drops from 24 KB to 8 KB.

### Added
- 5 new content-verifying TDD tests in `font_subset_post_and_cidtogidmap_test.rs` covering post version/length, CIDToGIDMap `/Filter /FlateDecode`, Flate compression ratio, and end-to-end PDF size regression.
- `examples/issue_165_repro.rs` — diagnostic script reproducing the user's exact snippet for local validation.

## [2.5.3] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- **TTF glyph hinting stripped from subset output** (#165) — `build_subset_font` now zeroes `instructionLength` on simple glyphs and truncates the trailing instruction block on composite glyphs (clearing `WE_HAVE_INSTRUCTIONS` on the last component). CJK fonts, where hinting is 30-60% of glyf size, benefit most.
- **FontFile2 / FontFile3 streams now FlateDecode-compressed** — Font-file stream bytes were previously written raw. TTF glyf data compresses 60-70% with zlib. Applies to both `/CIDFontType0C` (CFF) and `Length1`-carrying (TTF) streams.
- **ToUnicode CMap filtered to used characters** — The CMap generator emitted a bfchar entry for every glyph in the font (~14 KB for SourceSans3 Latin, ~65K entries for CJK fonts). Now emits entries only for characters actually present in the document, under Identity-H.
- **ToUnicode stream FlateDecode-compressed** — CMap streams with repetitive `<XXXX> <XXXX>` entries compress ~70%.
- **CFF String INDEX no longer copied verbatim into subset output** — Subsetted CFF output previously included the original font's full String INDEX (~22 KB for SourceSans3, ~5 KB for SourceHanSansSC) even though the rebuilt Top DICT only references standard SIDs. Now emits an empty String INDEX. CFF output matches typst `subsetter` crate size byte-for-byte.

### Impact
Measured PDF output sizes vs krilla reference:

| Case | oxidize v2.5.2 | oxidize v2.5.3 | krilla |
|---|---|---|---|
| Roboto TTF (45 Latin chars) | ~60 KB | ~20 KB | 8.9 KB |
| SourceSans3 CFF (45 Latin chars) | ~35 KB | ~8 KB | 6.8 KB |
| SourceHanSansSC CFF (30 CJK chars) | ~41 KB | ~12 KB | 9.9 KB |

### Added
- 16 new tests across unit + integration covering instruction stripping (simple/composite glyphs, edge cases, malformed input), FlateDecode filter on FontFile2/3 streams, ToUnicode filtering + compression, CFF String INDEX emptiness, and end-to-end PDF size regression guards.

### Removed
- `rebuild_cid_top_dict` function (75 lines) — obsoleted by the unified `build_cid_top_dict` path that drops cosmetic SID-referencing operators.

## [2.5.2] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- **CJK punctuation ToUnicode CMap offset math** — Correctly maps punctuation code points during CID CFF text extraction.

### Added
- Full CFF Type 2 charstring desubroutinizer replacing the Local Subr stub pipeline.
- SID-keyed CFF → CID-keyed conversion, always emitting raw CFF with `/Subtype /CIDFontType0C`.
- Strip TTF cmap, OS/2, name tables from subset output (not required for PDF embedding).

## [2.5.1] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed
- **CID CFF subset size optimization** (#165) — Local Subr subsetting filters unused subroutines to `endchar` stubs, reducing CID font subsets from ~1MB to <150KB (99.1% reduction from 16MB original). Global Subr INDEX also filtered transitively.

### Added
- Type 2 CharString parser for `callsubr`/`callgsubr` analysis
- Transitive BFS reachability analysis for Local and Global Subr INDEXes
- 25 new unit tests for subr parsing, traversal, and INDEX filtering

## [2.3.4] - 2026-03-26

  - Phase 7: Integration tests and VibeCoding golden paths
- **Pipeline profiling infrastructure** and performance baseline

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-03

### Changed
- **License**: AGPL-3.0 → MIT. After seeing the community grow around oxidize-pdf, I've decided to switch to MIT to make adoption easier for everyone. The AGPL was the right choice early on, but at this stage removing licensing friction will benefit the ecosystem more. I'll continue actively developing the library. Contributions welcome.
- **Version**: Major version bump to v2.0.0

### Added
- Text extraction thresholds for T1 (98%), T3 (90%), T5 (99%), T6 (85%) corpus tiers
- 7-tier test corpus infrastructure (T0-T6) with 9,000+ PDFs
- README rewrite reflecting current feature set (JBIG2, digital signatures, PDF/A, CCITTFax)

### Removed
- `docs/LICENSING_STRATEGY_ANALYSIS.md` (obsolete)

## [1.8.0] - 2026-02-28

  - **Robustness** - DoS limits (max 256MB bitmap), malformed data recovery, overflow protection
  - ~6,100 lines of implementation, 376 tests across 9 modules

### Fixed
- **🔧 Float Sort Panic (Rust 1.81+)** - Replaced all `partial_cmp().unwrap_or()` patterns with `f64::total_cmp()`
  - **Problem**: Rust's sort algorithm now enforces strict total ordering and panics on non-transitive comparators
  - **Root Cause**: `partial_cmp` returns `None` for NaN, and threshold-based "same line" detection broke transitivity
  - **Solution**: Quantized Y coordinates into bands for text fragment sorting; replaced all 23 `partial_cmp` usages with `total_cmp` (IEEE 754 total ordering)
  - **Affected modules**: text extraction, table detection, structured text, streaming, dashboard, forms, OCR, encoding

### Technical
- **Quality improvements** to JBIG2 decoder: `saturating_sub`/`checked_add` overflow protection, binary search Huffman decode, zero-copy `into_packed_bytes`/`into_finalize`, halftone grid formula correction per ITU-T T.88 §6.6.5.2
- **Tests**: 6,184 unit + 88 integration + 190 doc tests passing
- **Clippy**: Zero warnings
- **Breaking Changes**: None

## [1.7.1] - 2026-02-18

### Fixed
- **🔧 OTF Font Rendering in Firefox/pdf.js (Issue #127)** - OpenType CFF fonts now render correctly
  - **Problem**: OTF fonts with CFF outlines displayed unicode artifacts in Firefox/Librewolf on Linux
  - **Root Cause**: `CIDToGIDMap` was incorrectly generated for `CIDFontType0` (CFF) fonts
  - **ISO Reference**: Per ISO 32000-1:2008 §9.7.4.2, CFF fonts should NOT have `CIDToGIDMap`
  - **Solution**: Only generate `CIDToGIDMap` for `CIDFontType2` (TrueType) fonts
  - **Impact**: CFF/OpenType fonts (like Proxima Nova, Source Sans) now render correctly in pdf.js
  - **Location**: `oxidize-pdf-core/src/writer/pdf_writer/mod.rs`

- **🔧 PDF Merge Full Resource Resolution (Issue #128 Phase 3.5)** - XObject, ExtGState, ColorSpace, Pattern, Shading resources now preserved
- **🔧 Text Wrap in Tables (Issue #131)** - `text_wrap(true)` now wraps text instead of truncating

### Technical
- **Tests**: 5,877 unit tests passing
- **Breaking Changes**: None

  - Automatic conversion of BER (indefinite-length) to strict DER encoding
  - Required for signatures generated by pdfsig/NSS and other tools
  - **Location**: `oxidize-pdf-core/src/signatures/cms.rs`

### Fixed
- **🔧 PDF Merge Content Preservation (Issue #128)** - Merged PDFs now preserve original content
  - **Problem**: `merge_pdfs()` produced blank/corrupted PDFs when merging external documents
  - **Root Cause**: Old implementation reconstructed pages from parsed operators (lossy)
  - **Solution**: Now uses `Page::from_parsed_with_content()` to copy raw content streams
  - **Result**: Full preservation of fonts, images, and complex content
  - **Location**: `oxidize-pdf-core/src/operations/merge.rs`

### Security
- **🛡️ BER Parser DoS Protection** - Hardened against malicious input
  - Maximum nesting depth limit (100 levels) prevents stack overflow
  - Maximum output size limit (10 MB) prevents memory exhaustion
  - Improved length validation prevents buffer over-read

- **Test Fixtures**: 5 signed PDFs + certificates for signature testing
- **Breaking Changes**: None

## [1.6.13] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- **🔧 Indirect Stream Length Support (Issue #124)** - `PdfReader::new()` now handles PDFs with indirect `/Length` references
  - **Problem**: PDFs using `/Length 154 0 R` (indirect reference) failed with "requires lenient mode" error
  - **Root Cause**: `PdfReader::new()` used strict options while `PdfReader::open()` used lenient options
  - **Solution**: `PdfReader::new()` now enables `lenient_streams` by default for consistency
  - **Location**: `oxidize-pdf-core/src/parser/reader.rs`

### Technical
- **Tests**: 5,708 unit + 187 doc tests passing (+4 new tests for indirect Length)
- **Breaking Changes**: None (behavior is now more permissive, not less)

## [1.6.12] - 2026-02-06

### Added
- **🔄 Generic ImageExtractor** (PR #121 by @ho-229) - `ImageExtractor` now accepts any `Read + Seek` source
  - More flexible API for extracting images from various input sources
  - **Location**: `oxidize-pdf-core/src/operations/extract_images.rs`

### Improved

## [1.6.11] - 2026-02-01

### Added
- **📄 Per-Page Text Extraction Options** - New `extract_text_from_page_with_options` method
  - Combines functionality of `extract_text_from_page` and `extract_text_with_options`
  - Allows custom `ExtractionOptions` (e.g., `space_threshold`) for individual pages
  - **Use Case**: PDFs with pages requiring different extraction parameters
  - **Location**: `oxidize-pdf-core/src/parser/document.rs`

### Technical
- **Tests**: 5,005+ unit + 187 doc tests passing
- **Breaking Changes**: None

## [1.6.10] - 2026-01-29

### Fixed
- **🔧 Text Sanitization (Issue #116)** - Extracted text no longer contains NUL bytes
  - **Problem**: Text extraction returned `\0\u{3}` (NUL+ETX) instead of spaces between words
  - **Root Cause**: `encoding.rs` converted control bytes (0x00-0x1F) directly to chars without filtering
  - **Solution**: New `sanitize_extracted_text()` function in `extraction.rs`
    - Replaces `\0\u{3}` sequences with space (common word separator pattern)
    - Removes other ASCII control characters (except `\t`, `\n`, `\r`)
    - Collapses multiple consecutive spaces
  - **Location**: `oxidize-pdf-core/src/text/extraction.rs`

- **📏 Space Threshold Tuning** - Reduced false spaces in extracted text
  - **Problem**: Words like "two" extracted as "tw o" due to micro-adjustments in PDFs
  - **Solution**: Increased default `space_threshold` from 0.2 to 0.3
  - **Validation**: Analyzed 709 PDFs - 4.8% reduction in total spaces, 16.2% reduction in fragmented words
  - **Workaround**: Use `extract_text_with_options()` with higher threshold (0.4-0.5) if needed

### Added
- **🧪 Text Sanitization Tests** - 14 new TDD tests for sanitization logic

### Technical
- **Tests**: 5,008+ unit + 186 doc tests passing
- **Breaking Changes**: None

## [1.6.9] - 2026-01-17

### Fixed
- **🔧 Font Subsetting for Large Fonts (Issue #115)** - Fixed subsetting skip logic
  - **Problem**: Large fonts (e.g., 41MB CJK fonts) with few characters (<10) were being embedded fully instead of subsetted
  - **Root Cause**: `truetype_subsetter.rs` skipped subsetting based solely on character count (`< 10`), ignoring font size
  - **Solution**: New `should_skip_subsetting(font_size, char_count)` function considers BOTH factors
    - Skip only when font < 100KB AND character count < 10
    - Large fonts (≥100KB) are always subsetted regardless of character count
  - **Impact**: A 41MB font with 4 characters will now produce a ~10KB subset instead of embedding the full 41MB
  - **Location**: `oxidize-pdf-core/src/text/fonts/truetype_subsetter.rs`

### Added
- **🧪 Font Subsetting Tests** - 9 new TDD tests for subsetting logic
  - `test_issue_115_large_font_few_chars_should_subset` - Critical bug fix test
  - Edge cases: threshold boundaries, empty char sets, various font/char combinations
  - Constants validation for reasonable thresholds
